1325,2024-10-11 16:42:37,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cden551l7kko,How unusual has this hurricane season been?,Climate Change,Public Health & Environment,"Hurricanes Helene and Milton – which have devastated parts of the south-east United States – have bookended an exceptionally busy period of tropical storms. In less than two weeks, five hurricanes formed, which is not far off what the Atlantic would typically get in an entire year. The storms were powerful, gaining strength with rapid speed. Yet in early September, when hurricane activity is normally at its peak, there were peculiarly few storms. So, how unusual has this hurricane season been – and what is behind it? The season started ominously. On 2 July, Hurricane Beryl became the earliest category five hurricane to form in the Atlantic on records going back to 1920. Just a few weeks earlier in May, US scientists had warned the 2024 season from June to November could be “extraordinary” . It was thought that exceptionally warm Atlantic temperatures – combined with a shift in regional weather patterns – would make conditions ripe for hurricane formation. So far, with seven weeks of the official season still to go, there have been nine hurricanes – two more than the Atlantic would typically get. However, the total number of tropical storms – which includes hurricanes but also weaker storms – has been around average, and less than was expected at the start of the year. After Beryl weakened, there were only four named storms, and no major hurricanes, until Helene became a tropical storm on 24 September. That is despite warm waters in the tropical Atlantic, which should favour the growth of these storms. Across the Main Development Region for hurricanes - an area stretching from the west coast of Africa to the Caribbean - sea surface temperatures have been around 1C above the 1991-2020 average, according to BBC analysis of data from the European climate service. Atlantic temperatures have been higher over the last decade, mainly because of climate change and a natural weather pattern known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. The recipe for hurricane formation involves a complex mix of ingredients beyond sea temperatures, and these other conditions were not right. “The challenge [for forecasting] is that other factors can change quickly, on the timescale of days to weeks, and can work with or against the influence of sea surface temperatures,” explains Christina Patricola, associate professor at Iowa State University. Researchers are still working to understand why this was the case, but likely reasons include a shift to the West African monsoon and an abundance of Saharan dust. These both hampered storm development by creating unfavourable conditions in the atmosphere. But even during this period, scientists were warning that the oceans remained exceptionally warm and that intense hurricanes were still possible through the rest of the season. And in late September, they came. Starting with Helene, six tropical Atlantic storms were born in quick succession. Fuelled by very warm waters – and now more favourable atmospheric conditions – these storms strengthened, with five becoming hurricanes. Four of these five underwent what is known as “rapid intensification”, where maximum sustained wind speeds increase by at least 30 knots (35mph; 56km/h) in 24 hours. Historical data suggests that only around one in four hurricanes rapidly intensify on average. Rapid intensification can be particularly dangerous, because these quickly increasing wind speeds can give communities less time to prepare for a stronger storm. Hurricane Milton strengthened by more than 90mph in 24 hours – one of the fastest such cases of intensification ever recorded, according to BBC analysis of data from the National Hurricane Center. Scientists at the World Weather Attribution group have found that the winds and rain from both Helene and Milton were worsened by climate change. “One thing this hurricane season is illustrating clearly is that the impacts of climate change are here now,” explains Andra Garner from Rowan University in the US. “Storms like Beryl, Helene, and Milton all strengthened from fairly weak hurricanes into major hurricanes within 12 hours or less, as they travelled over unnaturally warm ocean waters.” Milton also took an unusual, although not unprecedented, storm path, tracking eastward through the Gulf of Mexico, where waters have been exceptionally warm. “It is very rare to see a [category] five hurricane appearing in Gulf of Mexico,” says Xiangbo Feng, research scientist in tropical cyclones at the University of Reading. Warmer oceans make stronger hurricanes - and rapid intensification - more likely, because it means storms can pick up more energy, potentially leading to higher wind speeds. US forecasters are currently watching an area of thunderstorms located over the Cabo Verde Islands off the west coast of Africa. This could develop into another tropical storm over the next couple of days, but that remains uncertain. As for the rest of the season, high sea surface temperatures remain conducive for further storms. There is also the likely development of the natural La Niña weather phenomenon in the Pacific, which often favours Atlantic hurricane formation as it affects wind patterns. But further activity will rely on other atmospheric conditions remaining favourable, which are not easy to predict. Either way, this season has already highlighted how warm seas fuelled by climate change are already increasing the chances of the strongest hurricanes – something that is expected to continue as the world warms further. “Hurricanes occur naturally, and in some parts of the world they are regarded as part of life,” explains Kevin Trenberth, a distinguished scholar at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, USA. “But human-caused climate change is supercharging them and exacerbating the risk of major damage.”","In less than two weeks, five hurricanes formed, which is not far off what the Atlantic would typically get in an entire year.

From elephants in tropical forests to hawksbill turtles off the Great Barrier Reef, populations are plummeting, according to a stocktake of the world's wildlife. The Living Planet Report , a comprehensive overview of the state of the natural world, reveals global wildlife populations have shrunk by an average of 73% in the past 50 years. The loss of wild spaces was  ""putting many ecosystems on the brink"", WWF UK head Tanya Steele said, and many habitats, from the Amazon to coral reefs, were ""on the edge of very dangerous tipping points"". The report is based on the Living Planet Index of more than 5,000 bird, mammal, amphibian, reptile and fish population counts over five decades. Among many snapshots of human-induced wildlife loss, it reveals 60% of the world's Amazon pink river dolphins have been wiped out by pollution and other threats, including mining and civil unrest. It also captured hopeful signs of conservation success. A sub-population of mountain gorillas in the Virunga Mountains of East Africa increased by about 3% per year between 2010 and 2016, for example. But the WWF said these “isolated successes are not enough, amid a backdrop of the widespread destruction of habitats”. Tom Oliver, professor of ecology at the University of Reading, who is unconnected with the report, said when this information was combined with other datasets, insect declines for example, ""we can piece together a robust - and worrying - picture of global biodiversity collapse”. The report found habitat degradation and loss was the biggest threat to wildlife, followed by overexploitation, invasive species, disease, climate change and pollution. Lead author and WWF chief scientific adviser Mike Barrett said through human action, ""particularly the way that we produce and consume our food, we are increasingly losing natural habitat”. The report also warns nature loss and climate change are fast pushing the world towards irreversible tipping points, including the potential ""collapse"" of the Amazon rainforest, whereby it can no longer lock away planet-warming carbon and mitigate the impacts of climate change. ""Please don't just feel sad about the loss of nature,"" Mr Barrett said. ""Be aware that this is now a fundamental threat to humanity and we've really got to do something now.” Valentina Marconi, from the Zoological Society of London’s Institute of Zoology, told BBC News the natural world was in a ""precarious position"" but with urgent, collective action from world leaders ""we still have the chance to reverse this"". This alarm call for the planet's wildlife comes as world leaders prepare to gather for the United Nations Biodiversity Conference, in Colombia, to discuss how to restore nature. Almost 200 countries have committed to a landmark 2022 UN agreement to tackle nature loss, including setting aside 30% of the planet for nature by 2030. The UK has signed up to the pledge, with the foreign secretary announcing the climate issue and decline in nature would be ""central"" to government policy. Ms Steele said the report was an ""incredible wake-up call"". ""Healthy ecosystems underpin our health, prosperity and wellbeing,"" she told BBC News. ""We don't think this sits on the shoulders of the average citizen - it's the responsibility of business and of government.

1581,2024-10-10 03:50:56,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6qz387qjgo,Explorer Shackleton’s lost ship as never seen before,Public Health & Environment,Society & Culture,"After more than 100 years hidden in the icy waters of Antarctica, Sir Ernest Shackleton’s ship Endurance has been revealed in extraordinary 3D detail. For the first time we can see the vessel, which sank in 1915 and lies 3,000m down at the bottom of the Weddell Sea, as if the murky water has been drained away. The digital scan, which is made from 25,000 high resolution images, was captured when the ship was found in 2022. It’s been released as part of a new documentary called Endurance, which will be shown at cinemas. The team has scoured the scan for tiny details, each of which tell a story linking the past to the present. In the picture below you can see the plates that the crew used for daily meals, left scattered across the deck. In the next picture there's a single boot that might have belonged to Frank Wild, Shackleton’s second-in-command. Perhaps most extraordinary of all is a flare gun that’s referenced in the journals the crew kept. The flare gun was fired by Frank Hurley, the expedition's photographer, as the ship that had been the crew’s home was lost to the ice. “Hurley gets this flare gun, and he fires the flare gun into the air with a massive detonator as a tribute to the ship,” explains Dr John Shears who led the expedition that found Endurance. ""And then in the diary, he talks about putting it down on the deck. And there we are. We come back over 100 years later, and there's that flare gun, incredible.” Sir Ernest Shackleton was an Anglo-Irish explorer who led the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, which set out to make the first land crossing of Antarctica. But the mission was doomed from the outset. Endurance became stuck in pack ice within weeks of setting off from South Georgia. The ship, with the crew on board, drifted for months before the order was eventually given to abandon ship. Endurance finally sank on 21 November 1915. Shackleton and his men were forced to travel for hundreds of miles over ice, land and sea to reach safety - miraculously all 27 of the crew survived. Their extraordinary story was recorded in their diaries, as well as in Frank Hurley's photographs, which have had colour added for the Endurance documentary. The ship itself remained lost until 2022. Its discovery made headlines around the world - and the footage of Endurance revealed that it is beautifully preserved by the icy waters. The new 3D scan was made using underwater robots that mapped the wreck from every angle, taking thousands of photographs. These were then “stitched” together to create a digital twin. While footage filmed at this depth can only show parts of Endurance in the gloom, the scan shows the complete 44m long wooden wreck from bow to stern  - even recording the grooves carved into the sediment as the ship skidded to a halt on the seafloor. The model reveals how the ship was crushed by the ice - the masts toppled and parts of the deck in tatters - but the structure itself is largely intact. Shackleton’s descendants say Endurance will never be raised - and its location in one of the most remote parts of the globe means visiting the wreck again would be extremely challenging. But Nico Vincent from Deep Ocean Search, who developed the technology for the scans, along with Voyis Imaging and McGill University, said the digital replica offers a new way to study the ship. “It's absolutely fabulous. The wreck is almost intact like she sank yesterday,” said Mr Vincent, who was also a co-leader for the expedition. He said the scan could be used by scientists to study the sea life that has colonised the wreck, to analyse the geology of the sea floor, and to discover new artefacts. “So this is really a great opportunity that we can offer for the future.” The scan belongs to the Falklands Maritime Heritage Trust who also funded and organised the expedition to find Shackleton’s ship. The Endurance documentary is premiering at the London Film Festival on 12 October and will be released in cinemas in the UK on 14 October.

Prof Hassabis, 48, co-founded the artificial intelligence (AI) company that became Google DeepMind. Professor John Jumper, 39, who worked with Prof Hassabis on the breakthrough, shares the award along with US-based Professor David Baker, 60. Proteins are the building blocks of life and are found in every cell in the human body. Better understanding proteins has driven huge breakthroughs in medicine. It is used in solving antibiotic resistance and to image enzymes that can decompose plastics. Prof Hassabis said it was the “honour of a lifetime” to receive the Nobel. “I’ve dedicated my whole life to working on AI because I believe in its potential to change the world,"" he said in a press conference on Wednesday. He said the Nobel committee did not have his phone number. Instead they called his wife, but she ignored the call several times before realising it was a Swedish number and might be important. He encouraged children to not only play computer games, but also make them, saying that his early gaming was the gateway to his experimentation with AI. Speaking about being awarded the prize, Prof John Jumper said it felt “so unreal at this moment"" but that “the prize represents the promise of computational biology”. But the Nobel committee also struggled to reach him. ""I got a number from a Swedish number and I absolutely could not believe it. I was really hoping it wasn’t a delivery or something,"" he said.  The pair of scientists used artificial intelligence to predict the structures of almost all known proteins and created a tool called AlphaFold2. Proteins are made of chains of building blocks called amino acids that each fold in a unique shape. Scientists had long struggled to predict the shape of each of the millions of proteins, but that structure drives what it does in the human body. Understanding the structure is crucial to knowing how to target the protein and alter its behaviour, which is crucial in medicine. The Nobel committee called AlphaFold2 a ""complete revolution"", and the tool is now used for 200 million proteins worldwide. Before the pair starting working on the problem, just a tiny fraction of protein structures had been worked out. The pair received one half of the Nobel prize. The other half was awarded to Prof Baker for what the committee called the ""almost impossible feat"" of building new proteins. In 2003 Prof Baker used amino acids to design a new protein, opening the door to the creation of new proteins used in pharmaceuticals, vaccines and other tools. He too used computer software in predicting protein structures, designing the Rosette programme in the 1990s. Prof Baker, who works at the University of Washington in Seattle, told the committee shortly after the announcement that he was ""very excited and very honoured"". ""I stood on the shoulders of giants,"" he said, when asked how he had cracked the code of creating proteins. He said he was sleeping when the phone rang, and when the announcement was made, his wife ""starting screaming very loudly"". The announcement was made by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences at a press conference in Stockholm, Sweden. The winners share a prize fund worth 11m Swedish kronor (£810,000). Prof Baker will receive half of the award, with the remaining half going to Prof Hassabis and Prof Jumper. Prof Hassabis grew up in London with Greek-Cypriot and Singaporean parents. He was a child prodigy in chess and reached master standard at the age of 13. He completed his A-levels aged 16 and was asked by Cambridge University to take a gap year due to his young age. Before and after graduating in computer science, he worked in computer game design, winning numerous awards. He then completed a PhD at University College London, before working at several US universities. In 2010 he co-founded machine learning company DeepMind that was bought by Google in 2014. It aims to use neuroscience with machine learning to produce powerful algorithms that can be applied to a range of problems. His work has won numerous awards, now including the Nobel Prize for Chemistry.","Prof Demis Hassabis, 48, co-founded the artificial intelligence company that became Google DeepMind.

Voters chose 128 Grazer, a mother bear who won Fat Bear Week last year, and whose cub was recently killed by her last remaining opponent in the competition, 32 Chunk. The competition, which started a decade ago, allows viewers to watch live cameras of Alaska's Katmai National Park and Preserve and pick their favourite brown bear after the animals have beefed up on salmon in preparation for winter. In a post on X, explore.org, the nature network that runs the contest, said 128 Grazer was ""the first working mom to ever be crowned champion"". In July, two of Grazer's cubs were swept over a waterfall, where Chunk - the most dominant bear on the river - attacked them both, according to explore.org. One later succumbed to its injuries. The two bears were later pitted against each other in Fat Bear Week's competition, with Grazer eventually coming out on top, winning more than double Chunk’s votes with more than 71,000 votes. A highly defensive mother bear, the 20-year-old Grazer is raising her third litter. ""Her fearless nature is respected by other bears who often choose to give her space instead of risking a confrontation. This elevates Grazer’s rank in the bear hierarchy above almost all bears except for the largest males,"" her bear profile states. Fat Bear Week came after a grisly series of events this year. The beginning of the contest was delayed by one day after a female bear was killed by a male bear on camera. Each year, 12 bears are chosen for the Fat Bear Week bracket and fans can vote online to decide the winner. Grazer also beat Chunk in 2023, when nearly 1.4 million votes were cast from more than 100 countries, according to Katmai Conservancy and explore.org.","128 Grazer, a mother bear who won Fat Bear Week last year, has been crowned.

1965,2024-10-08 11:52:40,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62r02z75jyo,'Godfather of AI' shares Nobel Physics Prize,Technology & Science,Public Health & Environment,"The Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to two scientists, Geoffrey Hinton and John Hopfield, for their work on machine learning. British-Canadian Professor Hinton is sometimes referred to as the ""Godfather of AI"" and said he was flabbergasted. He resigned from Google in 2023, and has warned about the dangers of machines that could outsmart humans. The announcement was made by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences at a press conference in Stockholm, Sweden. American Professor John Hopfield, 91, is a professor at Princeton University in the US, and Prof Hinton, 76, is a professor at University of Toronto in Canada. Machine learning is key to artificial intelligence as it develops how a computer can train itself to generate information. It drives a vast range of technology that we use today from how we search the internet to editing photographs on our phones. “I had no idea this would happen. I'm very surprised,” said Prof Hinton, speaking on the phone to the Academy minutes after the announcement. He said he was in a hotel with bad internet in California and thought he might need to cancel the rest of his day's plans. The Academy listed some of the crucial applications of the two scientists’ work, including improving climate modelling, development of solar cells, and analysis of medical images. Prof Hinton's pioneering research on neural networks paved the way for current AI systems like ChatGPT. In artificial intelligence, neural networks are systems that are similar to the human brain in the way they learn and process information. They enable AIs to learn from experience, as a person would. This is called deep learning. Prof Hinton said his work on artificial neural networks was revolutionary. “It’s going to be like the Industrial Revolution - but instead of our physical capabilities, it’s going to exceed our intellectual capabilities,"" he said. But he said he also had concerns about the future. He was asked if he regretted his life's work as he told journalist last year. In reply, he said he would do the same work again, ""but I worry that the overall consequences of this might be systems that are more intelligent than us that might eventually take control"". He also said he uses the AI chatbot ChatGPT4 for many things now but with the knowledge that it does not always get the answer right. Professor John Hopfield invented a network that can save and recreate patterns. It uses physics that describes a material’s characteristics due to atomic spin. In a similar way to how the brain tries to recall words by using associated but incomplete words, Prof Hopfield developed a network that can use incomplete patterns to find the most similar. The Nobel Prize committee said the two scientists' work has become part of our daily lives, including in facial recognition and language translation. But Ellen Moons, chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics, said ""its rapid development has also raised concerns about our future collectively"". The winners share a prize fund worth 11m Swedish kronor (£810,000). When Prof Hinton resigned from Google last year, he told the BBC some of the dangers of AI chatbots were ""quite scary"". He also said at the time that his age had played into his decision to leave the tech giant. Earlier this year, in an interview with BBC Newsnight, he said the UK government will have to establish a universal basic income to deal with the impact of AI on inequality, as he was “very worried about AI taking lots of mundane jobs”. He added that while AI would increase productivity and wealth, the money would go to the rich “and not the people whose jobs get lost and that’s going to be very bad for society”. In the same interview, he said developments over the last year showed governments were unwilling to rein in military use of AI while the competition to develop products rapidly meant there was a risk tech companies wouldn't “put enough effort into safety”. Prof Hinton said ""my guess is in between five and 20 years from now there’s a probability of half that we’ll have to confront the problem of AI trying to take over"".","Geoffrey Hinton, 76, and John Hopfield, 91, have been awarded the prize.

2093,2024-10-08 08:02:58,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r84lnng4eo,Water firms told to cut customer bills over poor performance,Public Health & Environment,Sustainability,"Water companies have been ordered to return £158m to customers via lower bills next year after missing key targets on pollution and leaks. But most customers will only see their bills fall by less than £10. This is the fourth year in a row that firms have had to refund customers, prompting questions over the effectiveness of the regulator. Industry body Water UK told the BBC that companies had made improvements across most measures and they were committed to boosting their performance. Ofwat assesses the performance of the 17 largest water and wastewater companies in England and Wales each year against key targets, for issues such as sewer flooding, supply interruptions and water leaks. For the second year in a row, no company achieved the top rating, although four companies did show an improvement from last year. For the worst performing companies, failure to meet the targets means they will now have to collectively return £157.6m to customers on their bills for 2025-2026. The effectiveness of the fines and Ofwat's ability to regulate the industry has been questioned given companies had under-performed for four years in a row. Defending the regulator, CEO David Black, told the BBC's Today programme: ""It is for water companies and their boards, multi-billion pound enterprises, to turnaround their performance. We agree there is much more to be done and we will continue to work to drive the sector to perform better."" Thames Water will have to make the largest repayment to customers of £56.8m, although its overall performance improved from last year. Despite the record fine most customers will see their bills fall by only a few pounds. Any reduction will be dwarfed by the expected long-term increase of £94 per household over the next five years, which Ofwat is currently proposing. This price rise is still being negotiated with water companies as part of their investment plans. The companies argue that even higher bills will be needed if they are to afford the infrastructure improvements required to tackle some of the issues raised in this performance report. Ofwat's review looked at key targets including reducing pollution incidents, which were meant to fall by 30% between 2020 and 2025. Companies had achieved a 15% reduction over the last few years. But that improvement has been almost wiped out by the significantly higher number of incidents last year. The industry has said that although this performance was unacceptable, the record levels were due to heavy rain and more sites now being monitored. But Ofwat's David Black said: “It is clear that companies need to change and that has to start with addressing issues of culture and leadership. Too often we hear that weather, third parties or external factors are blamed for shortcomings.” Public dissatisfaction with the industry has risen in recent years particularly in relation to pollution. CEO of campaign group River Action James Wallace said: ""This might sound like a lot of money but frankly it is a drop in the ocean for polluting water companies."" Mr Wallace questioned whether Ofwat was an effective regulator, ""The new Government is taking some positive steps, including a review of the water sector and the introduction of a Water Bill. However, we believe the bill, as currently drafted, falls short. Where is the duty on Ofwat to prioritise the environment and penalise pollution?"" he said. David Henderson, chief executive of Water UK, told the BBC's Today Programme: ""Performance is clearly not where it should be, and companies are fully committed to boosting that performance. ""It is important to note though that it is not all bad, across every single measure all but two, water companies have delivered improvements since the start of the decade - leakage is at is lowest level in history."" Ofwat estimates that currently about a fifth of all water put into the network in England and Wales is lost via leaks. This is an important area for the industry to tackle because many areas of England already regularly experience water shortages and climate change is expected to exacerbate this issue. The Environment Agency estimates that the country will need an additional 5 billion litres of water a day by 2050 to support the economy and environment. Some companies were praised in the report for their efforts to tackle this and other issues, including Severn Trent, which Ofwat said had managed to cut sewage spills by delivering improvements at 467 sites. Severn Trent, SES Water, Northumbrian Water, and United Utilities exceeded their targets and therefore will be able to charge customers more next year, as part of a scheme to incentivise the industry. Following the release of the report, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the environment secretary would be writing to the Chairs and CEOs of every water company laying out the performance improvements that he expects them to make in the coming year.

Storm Boris has ravaged countries including Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Austria and Italy, leading to at least 24 deaths and billions of pounds of damage. The World Weather Attribution (WWA) group said one recent four-day period was the rainiest ever recorded in central Europe - an intensity made twice as likely by climate change. On a positive note, the storm was well forecast, meaning some regions were better prepared for it, likely avoiding more deaths. Scientists at WWA work out how much of a role climate change played in an extreme weather event by comparing it with a model of how bad that storm, drought or heatwave might have been in a world where humans hadn't been burning fossil fuels for nearly 200 years. The kind of rainfall unleashed by Boris is thankfully still rare – expected to occur about once every 100-300 years in today’s climate, which has warmed by about 1.3C due to greenhouse gas emissions. But if warming reaches 2C, similar episodes will become an extra 5% more intense and 50% more frequent, the WWA warned. Without more ambitious climate action, global warming is expected to reach around 3C by the end of the century. “This is definitely what we will see much more of in the future,” said Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College London and co-author of the WWA study. ""[It] is the absolute fingerprint signature of climate change [...] that records are broken by such a large margin."" The record rains fit into the broader pattern of how Europe’s climate is changing in a warming world. Europe is the fastest-warming continent. The last five years were on average around 2.3C warmer than the second half of the 19th Century, according to the Copernicus climate service. This not only brings much more frequent and intense heatwaves, but also more extreme rainfall, particularly over north and central Europe. The picture is more complicated in southern Europe, due to shifts in large-scale weather patterns. The simplest reason for more intense rainfall in a hotter world is that a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture – about 7% for every 1C. This extra moisture can lead to heavier rainfall. One reason Boris has produced so much rain is that the weather system got 'stuck',  dumping huge amounts of water over the same areas for days. There is some evidence that the effects of climate change on the jet stream - a band of fast-flowing winds high up in the atmosphere - may make this 'stalling' phenomenon more common. But this is still up for debate. Even if we don't get more 'stalled' weather systems in the future, climate change means that any that do get stuck can carry more moisture and therefore be potentially disastrous. “These weather patterns occurred in a warmer climate because of our greenhouse gas emissions, [so] the intensity and volume of rainfall was larger than it would have otherwise been,” explains Richard Allan, professor in climate science at the University of Reading. Weather forecasts are continually improving, and in this case the huge levels of rainfall that triggered the floods were forecast several days in advance. That meant flood preparations could be put in place. That's partly why the death toll was not as bad as previous major flooding in 1997 and 2002, even though the recent rain was heavier in many places and the floods covered a larger area. “There has been a lot of money spent after the previous two floods to [install and update] the flood defences,” explains Mirek Trnka of the Global Change Research Institute in the Czech Republic, one of the countries most affected by the flooding. In the city of Brno, for example, where Prof Trnka is based, not all of the flood defences had been completed, but the advanced warning allowed authorities to strengthen areas where there was still work to be done. Not everywhere in Europe has been as fortunate. The EU has pledged €10bn (£8.3bn) in emergency repairs to help affected areas. “It shows just how expensive climate change is,” says Dr Otto. Over recent decades, improved flood protection has largely shielded communities from increased impacts. But there are concerns that rising temperatures - and so ever increasing extreme rainfall - could make them ineffective. “The [severity of the] flood events is going to increase considerably in the future, so if you keep the flood protections at the same level as they are today, the impacts may become unbearable for societies in Europe,” explains Francesco Dottori of IUSS in Pavia, Italy. There is of course a clear way to stop these rainfall events from getting ever worse - cutting emissions of planet-warming gases such as carbon dioxide. “Our simulations show that if you are able to keep future global warming below 1.5C, which is one of the targets of the Paris agreement, then future flood damage will be cut by half compared to the [business as usual] scenario,” Dr Dottori adds. Otherwise, we know what will happen to these events in the future, Prof Allan says. ""The intensity of rainfall and these weather events will only get worse.""

2349,2024-09-17 09:51:11,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c05j3q07p3yo,Sir David Attenborough: 'The world would be worse off without our stories',Wildlife & Conservation,Public Health & Environment,"Seventy years after he first fronted a wildlife programme, Sir David Attenborough is keenly aware of the impact they can have. ""The world would be in a far, far worse situation now had there been no broadcasting of natural history,"" he said. ""People have found it a source of fascination and beauty and interest, and this has become key to looking after the world."" In September 2024, the BBC is marking 90 years of broadcasting from Bristol . We spoke exclusively to Sir David, who has presented many of the programmes made at BBC Bristol's Natural History Unit. When Sir David's broadcasting career began in 1954, just 3.2 million people had television licences in the UK. The goal of programmes like Zoo Quest was to capture wild animals for zoo collections, the accepted practice at the time. Now, Sir David's programmes all carry a strong message - that the natural world is at risk more than ever before. ""People are aware of the problems of conservation in a way which could not exist without broadcasting,"" he said. ""The perilous state that the natural world is in at the moment, these things are apparent to people all around the world. ""You don't watch a natural history programme, I hope, because you think it's going to be good for the natural world; you do so because it is rivetingly interesting, and complicated, and beautiful. ""The awareness of people around the world about ecological damage, that is due to natural history,"" he added. Bristol's association with wildlife programming goes back to the mid 1940s, when The Naturalist was produced on the Home Service by Desmond Hawkins from the city. ""Desmond was the king of natural history broadcasting and an accomplished naturalist,"" said Sir David. Ten years later, in 1955, wildlife programme Look, presented by Peter Scott, featured pioneering German filmmaker, Heinz Sielmann, the first person to film inside a woodpecker's nest. ""This was sensational, everyone in Britain was blown away by this, and because there was only one television network, it was all you talked about at the bus stop when you were going into work,"" recalls Sir David. The switchboard at the Lime Grove studios was jammed with viewers ringing in to find out more, and it gave the BBC the nudge to set up the Natural History Unit in Bristol in 1957. In 1979, Sir David presented Life on Earth, a landmark television programme made in Bristol, which attracted around 15 million viewers. ""Bristol led the world to be truthful,"" he said. ""It started this with radio, and when television came along, Peter Scott and Desmond Hawkins continued that tradition. ""The other big mega power in broadcasting was the United States, and in the 1970s,  viewers there thought natural history was just lions attacking antelopes. ""Bristol's programmes taught them that termites could be just as interesting. ""When we first started trying to get the subscriptions to finance the plans I had, I remember making the mistake in pitching this to an American network controller. ""I waxed very eloquently about how the programme would be the history of life from the microscopic beginning, and the executive turned to me and said 'you mean it's going to be about green slime?' ""I replied 'more or less,' but we managed to flog it in the end."" Sir David's programmes have gone from being shot on 16mm film stock with clockwork cameras in 1954 to ultra high definition 4k in the present day. When he was making Zoo Quest , cameras would only film for 40 seconds before the clockwork motor ran out. Today, filmmakers gather hundreds of hours of video just to capture one special moment which may only last for seconds. ""When we started, the film people in London were very derisory about 16mm, they called it 'bootlace'. ""We couldn't film on 35mm because we couldn't drag around those enormous great big cameras. ""Almost every year, we had better facilities. The film became smaller, the recording apparatus became more sensitive. ""I've tried to film Orangutan, and they do absolutely nothing - they just sit in the trees, and they're very difficult to see. ""Now along comes a drone, and you can film things that you couldn't possibly ever see from the ground,"" Sir David said. Sir David was awarded Freedom of the City of Bristol in 2013, to mark his connections with the programmes made there. He almost became a Bristolian, but family life and work pressures intervened. ""In 1955, I was told I was to be made head of the Natural History Unit in Bristol, and I said I would prefer not to do so because I had just bought a house in London, my son and daughter were fixed in schools. ""I also had responsibility for Prime Ministerial broadcasts with Anthony Eden, which I wasn't all that interested in, but nonetheless I had the responsibilities. ""Had it happened three years earlier I probably would have been there. ""It is always a joy to visit Bristol, the city has a regional personality. ""If you're a broadcaster, particularly a natural history broadcaster, there is nowhere else like Bristol in the world."" In his 98th year, Sir David's next programme is a seven-part series called Asia, which will premiere later in 2024. But despite the global acclaim his career has earned him, he remains very modest about his role in the shows he presents. ""I'm given huge credit for things that have nothing to do with me, because I speak the words and that's the easiest business part of the entire outfit,"" he said. ""A lot of people think that I'm there recording the programme, working the camera, working out the travel and putting in the expertise, whereas all of these things are part of the team. ""People are aware of the problems of conservation in a way that could not exist without broadcasting, and the BBC can claim that we're leading that,"" he added.

55,2024-09-15 03:08:06,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8l3x9e8ezo,Titan sub disaster: Five key questions that remain,Public Health & Environment,Politics & Law,"It was the submersible that promised passengers the trip of a lifetime. A chance to descend 3,800m (12,500ft) to the Atlantic depths to visit the wreck of the Titanic. But last year, a dive by Oceangate’s Titan sub went tragically wrong. The vessel suffered a catastrophic failure as it neared the sea floor, killing all five people onboard. The US Coast Guard is holding a public hearing on 16 September to examine why the disaster happened, from the sub’s unconventional design to ignored safety warnings and the lack of regulation in the deep. Titan began its descent beneath the waves on the morning of 18 June 2023. On board were Oceangate’s CEO Stockton Rush, British explorer Hamish Harding, veteran French diver Paul Henri Nargeolet, the British-Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman. Later that day, after the craft failed to resurface, the US Coast Guard was notified, sparking a vast search and rescue operation. The world watched and waited for news of the missing sub.  But on 22 June, wreckage was discovered about 500m (1,600ft) from Titanic’s bow. Titan had imploded just one hour and 45 minutes into the dive. These are five key questions that still need to be answered. Those on Titan could stay in contact with the support ship, the Polar Prince, with text messages sent through its onboard communications system. The log of these exchanges could reveal if there were any indications that the sub was failing. The vessel also had an acoustic monitoring device - essentially mics fixed to the sub listening for signs it was buckling or breaking. “Stockton Rush was convinced that if there was an imminent failure of the submersible, they would get an audio warning on that system,” explains Victor Vescovo, a leading deep sea explorer. But he said he was highly sceptical that this would have provided enough time for the sub to return to the surface. “The issue is how quickly would that warning happen?” If there were no apparent problems during the descent and alarms failed to sound, those on board could have been unaware of their imminent fate. The implosion itself was instantaneous, there would have been no time for the passengers to even register what was happening. Forensic experts have been examining Titan’s wreckage to find the root of the failure. There were several issues with its design. The viewport window was only rated to a depth of 1,300m (4,300ft) by its manufacturer, but Titan was diving almost three times deeper. Titan’s hull was also an unusual shape - cylindrical, rather than spherical. Most deep-sea subs have a spherical hull, so the effect of the crushing pressure of the deep is distributed equally. The sub’s hull was also made out of carbon fibre, an unconventional material for a deep-sea vessel. Metals such as titanium are most commonly used as they are reliable under immense pressures. “Carbon fibre is considered to be a material that is unpredictable [in the deep ocean],” explains Patrick Lahey, CEO of Triton Submarines, a leading manufacturer. Every time Titan went down to the Titanic - and it had made multiple dives - the carbon fibre was compressed and damaged. “It was getting progressively weaker because the fibres were breaking,” he said. The junctions between different materials also gave cause for concern. The carbon fibre was attached to two rings of titanium, creating weak points. Patrick Lahey said the commercial sub industry had a longstanding, unblemished safety record. “The Oceangate contraption was an aberration,” he told BBC News. Ships, aircraft and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) were scrambled to the Atlantic to try to find Titan. A couple of days into the search, there were reports of underwater noises picked up by a search plane’s sonar, raising the possibility they were coming from the sub. ROVs were sent to locate the source but found nothing. It is still not clear what the sounds were - the ocean is noisy and even more so during an operation like this. A more pertinent subsea sound was detected by the US Navy’s sonar system at the time the sub went missing - an acoustic signal consistent with an implosion. The information was only made public on the day the remains of Titan were found. It is not known when the US Coast Guard was told of the noise - or whether the families and friends waiting on the sub’s support ship were informed. Eventually the deep-sea robots returned to where Titan had gone missing and the wreckage was found. Rory Golden, who was on the Oceangate expedition when contact was lost, recently told the BBC those on board the surface vessel experienced four days of fear and “false hope”. Many were concerned about Oceangate’s sub. Victor Vescovo says he was so worried, he had urged several passengers against diving on Titan - including his friend Hamish Harding, one of the five who died. “I told him, in no uncertain terms, that he should not get in the submersible,” he said. Fears about safety were also brought directly to Oceangate - including by the company’s former director of marine operations, David Lochridge, who assessed the sub while it was being developed. US court documents from 2018 show that Lochridge had identified numerous “serious safety concerns” and the lack of testing could “subject passengers to potential extreme danger in an experimental submersible”. Engineers from the Marine Technology Society also said that Oceangate’s experimental approach could result in “negative outcomes (from minor to catastrophic)” in a letter shared with Stockton Rush. In an email exchange shown to BBC News last year , deep-sea specialist Rob McCallum told Rush that the sub should not be used for commercial deep dive operations and was placing passengers in a “dangerous dynamic”. In response, Rush said he had “grown tired of industry players who try to use a safety argument to stop innovation” and dismissed warnings that he would kill someone as “baseless”. With the death of Oceangate’s CEO, we will never be able to ask why he chose not to listen to these concerns. But the public hearings could reveal who else at the company knew about them  - and why no action was taken. Deep-sea submersibles can go through an extensive safety assessment carried out by independent, specialist, marine organisations such as the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) or DNV (a global accreditation organisation based in Norway). Oceangate chose not to put Titan through this process. The assessment would have confirmed whether the vessel - from its design through to construction, testing and operations - met certain standards. Most operators opt to have their deep-sea subs certified - but it is not mandatory. Rush described his sub as “experimental” and, in a blog post in 2019, he argued that certification “slowed down innovation”. In an email exchange with Rob McCallum, he said he didn’t need a piece of paper to show Titan was safe, and that his own protocols and the “informed consent” of passengers were enough. The passengers on Titan paid up to $250,000 (£191,135) for a place. They all had to sign a liability waiver. Irish businessman Oisin Fanning made two dives in Titan in 2022 - the last before the sub’s fatal disaster. He said the Oceangate team took safety seriously, with extensive briefings before each descent. But it wasn’t made clear to him that Titan had not been certified. “I would be lying if I said I didn't think there had been something like that done already - that it conformed with certain norms,” he said. “We all knew that the Titan was experimental. We were very confident, because obviously there'd been a few dives before that, and it seemed to be working well.” The public hearings will last for two weeks. The hope is the answers it provides could prevent a disaster like this from happening again.","Oceangate’s Titan sub went down to visit the Titanic in June 2023.

311,2024-09-11 01:17:18,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74j2lz88pwo,The great gene editing debate: can it be safe and ethical?,Agriculture & Food,Politics & Law,"There’s nothing new about genetic engineering. By cross-breeding plants and animals, our Stone Age ancestors realised they could boost the amount of food they produced. Modern genetics has enabled scientists to do much more: to make precise, targeted changes to the DNA of organisms in a lab. And that, they claim, will lead to new, more productive, disease-resistant crops and animals. The science is still in its infancy, but gene-edited foods are already on the shelves in Japan: tomatoes rich in a chemical that supposedly promotes calmness; red sea bream with extra edible flesh; and puffer fish that grow more quickly. In the US, too, firms are developing heat-resistant cattle, pit-less cherries and seedless blackberries. Supporters of the technology say it could reduce animal diseases and suffering and lead to the use of fewer antibiotics. They also believe it could tackle climate change by lowering emissions of the greenhouse gas methane - produced by livestock such as cows, goats and deer when their stomachs are breaking down hard fibres like grass for digestion. But opponents say gene editing is still not proven to be safe and that they remain concerned about the implications for animal welfare. Now a law permitting gene-edited food to be sold in the UK has been paused and some British scientists warn they could be overtaken by other countries. The new Labour government has pledged closer alignment with the European Union, particularly on regulations that might affect trade. And currently, the EU has much stricter rules around the commercial sale of gene-edited and genetically modified crops. The EU set stringent regulations on genetically modified (GM) crops decades ago because of safety concerns and public opposition to the technology. Gene-edited crops are covered by the same regulations. But to scientists, the terms “gene editing” and “GM” refer to different things. GM, a much older technology, involves adding new genes to plants and animals to make them more productive or disease-resistant. Sometimes these new genes were from entirely different species - for example , a cotton plant with a scorpion gene to make it taste unpleasant to insects. By contrast, gene editing involves making more precise changes to the plant or the animal’s DNA. These changes are often quite small ones, which involve editing sections of the DNA into a form that, its advocates say, could be produced through natural means like traditional cross-breeding, only much faster. Along with the US and China, the UK is among the countries that lead the world in gene editing. Last year the previous government passed the Precision Breeding Act, which paved the way for the commercial sale of gene-edited food in England. At the time, many scientists working in the field were overjoyed. “I thought: ‘Great, this is going to uncork a whole area of activity in the public and private sector’ and we could build an entrepreneurial community for gene editing in the UK,” says Prof Jonathan Napier of Rothamsted Research, a government agricultural research institute in Harpenden. But he says his hopes were soon dashed. For the law to come into effect, secondary legislation was required, and this was due to be passed by Parliament this July. But the earlier-than-expected election meant that it was not voted on by MPs and the Act is currently in limbo. Prof Napier was among 50 leading scientists to write to the newly appointed ministers at the Department for Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) at the end of July asking them to act “quickly and decisively” to pass the secondary legislation. The Defra minister responsible, Daniel Zeichner, responded to the scientists’ plea last week by stating that the government was “now considering how to take forward the regulatory framework outlined in the Act and will share our plans with key interested parties soon”. One of the prime movers behind the scientists’ letter, leading expert Prof Tina Barsby, described the minister’s response as a “encouraging” but said that his promise of clarity “soon” had to mean really soon. Other countries, she said, were pressing ahead with their plans for gene edited-crops at great speed. Thailand recently joined Canada, Australia, Japan, Brazil, Argentina and the USA in adopting regulations around gene editing. Even New Zealand, which according to Prof Barsby “has historically taken a more cautious regulatory approach to genetic technologies”, has announced that it will also introduce new legislation. Prof Barsby added: “With our world-leading science base in genetic research, we cannot afford to be left behind.” But Defra ministers also have to consider the views of environmental campaigners, such as Dr Helen Wallace of Genewatch UK, who have concerns about the “unwanted consequences” of the Precision Breeding Act. “If you remove these plants and animals from GM regulations then you don’t have the same degree of risk assessment, you don’t have labelling and you risk markets because many of them regulate them as GMOs,” she says. Dr Peter Stevenson, who is the chief policy advisor to UK-based Compassion in World Farming (CIWF), also fears that the technology will further add to the intensification of animal farming - with negative consequences. “The use of selective breeding over the past 50 years has brought a huge number of animal welfare problems,” he says. “Chickens have been bred to grow so quickly that their legs and hearts can’t properly support the rapidly developing body and as a result millions of animals are suffering from painful leg disorders, while others succumb to heart disease. “Do we really want to accelerate this process with gene editing?” CIWF’s biggest fear is that gene-editing animals to make them more resistant to diseases will mean that the industry will not be motivated to deal with the conditions that lead to the animals getting ill in the first place - such as crowded, unsanitary conditions. The intensity of the production of milk, meat, and eggs currently leaves many animals “exhausted and broken”, Mr Stevenson told BBC News. Any genetic alteration to an animal has the potential to have negative effects. But advocates say that for any commercial application, firms have to demonstrate to the regulator that their changes do not harm the animal and back this up with data. Indeed, many of those who argue for the use of gene-editing technology do so partly on animal welfare grounds - because it could make farm animals more resistant to disease and, since fewer would die as a result, fewer would be needed in the first place. Another of the letter’s signatories is Prof Helen Sang, who has laid the foundations for using gene editing to develop bird flu resistance in chickens. “With a virulent strain of (the pig disease) PRRS wiping out pig herds in Spain, African Swine Fever on the march north through Europe, and bird flu virus detected in both dairy cattle and their milk in the US, the importance of enabling all possible solutions, including precision breeding, cannot be overstated,” she said in response to Mr Zeichner. Some of the solutions to the problems Prof Sang mentions are already waiting in the wings. She works at the Roslin Institute, where Dolly the Sheep was cloned nearly 30 years ago. It now leads the world in developing gene-edited animals. Prof Sang’s colleagues at Roslin developed a strain of pig that is resistant to the PRRS pig disease six years ago. They can’t yet be commercially sold to UK pig farmers - but Genus, a British company that has commercialised the PRRS-resistant pigs, has received regulatory approval for their use in Colombia. The firm also has an application for permission to introduce the pigs to the US market which, if given the green light, could be approved as early as next spring. Genus is also planning to seek approval for the commercial use of their gene-edited pigs in Canada, Mexico and Japan. Despite the strong opinions on both sides, there appears to be scope for consensus around some applications of the technology. For instance, Mr Stevenson of CIWF does think it’s at least possible that gene editing could be applied in an ethical way. To do so, he says, it would need to meet three criteria: that any change it brings about is unlikely to cause animal welfare problems; that its objectives cannot be met by any less intensive means; and that it will not have the effect of entrenching industrialised livestock production. The PRRS-resistant pigs may tick all three boxes in specific circumstances, according to Mr Stevenson, as do efforts to use gene editing to enable the egg-production industry to produce female-only chicks to avoid the need for billions of male chicks being killed each year when they are just a day old. Likewise, Prof Mizeck Chagunda, who is the director of the Centre for Tropical Genetics and Health, which is also based at the Roslin Institute, believes both in the positive potential of gene editing and that it needs to be carefully overseen. He says the technology could improve the lives of the poorest farmers in the world: “70% to 80% of farmers are smallholding farms with two to three animals.” A devastating disease can leave a farmer and their family with nothing. “So, giving them animals that have been prepared with these technologies would help to protect them from this huge risk to their livelihoods,” says Prof Chagunda. However, Prof Chagunda warns that there needs to be good, strong regulations in place if this technology is to be accepted by the public. “Some changes can be too experimental, and we should not be doing them,” he says. “Scientists should be working with the regulatory authorities to achieve the good products that the farmers and consumers are looking for. We should be doing science that is ethical and at the same time helping humanity.” The gene editing work at Roslin is led by its director, Prof Bruce Whitelaw, who was a scientist at the institute when Dolly the sheep was cloned. In the past he has been through the process of explaining the potential benefits of seemingly alarming technological developments and he believes there is an urgent need to do so again now. “We are world leaders in the technology and sitting at top table in terms of developing it,” he says. “If we don’t have the legislation to do that, then our credentials to sit there will slowly wither away and we will lose investment, scientific talent and the boost to our economy to other countries.” There are lessons here from the past. Genetic modification was rejected by many consumers in the UK, the European Union and other countries 30 years ago because of its perceived unnaturalness. GM crops were publicly trampled by protestors who saw this as a technology that they didn’t need, want or consider safe. At the same time, scientists were angry and upset that what they believed to be their world-saving technology was being destroyed by, in their view, a wave of anti-scientific hysteria fuelled by the media. Gene editing seems to be a more palatable version of GM to some, arriving at a time when the debate is less polarised, the need for environmental solutions is even more urgent and there seems to be a greater readiness for some scientists and campaigners to see each other’s perspectives. Mr Stevenson of CWIF believes that in the long run, there has to be “huge reductions” in global livestock production to deal with climate change, but pragmatically, the fact that climate change is already destroying so many lives, the use of gene editing could be “legitimate”. But he is wary. “It is hard for me to trust that part of the scientific world who say: ‘Hey now, we have a new way to alter animals.’ “The danger is of animals being thought of as things, units of production, more so than they are now, because we can modify them to make them more amenable to our uses and taking us away from this notion of animals as sentient beings.” What happens next, not just in the UK, but the rest of the world, depends on whether the advocates of gene editing can convince the open-minded, but wary, such as Mr Stevenson, that they can act safely, ethically and in a way that makes lives better, not worse - for people and animals alike.

439,2024-09-09 02:20:51,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czx6e2x0kdyo,Which rural area will take the UK’s nuclear waste?,Public Health & Environment,Sustainability,"A repeating tone - blip, blip, blip - is the audible reminder that we are in one of the most hazardous nuclear sites in the world: Sellafield. That sound - pulsing from speakers inside the cavernous fuel-handling plant - is a signal that everything is functioning as it should. That is comforting because Sellafield, in Cumbria, is the temporary home to the vast majority of the UK’s radioactive nuclear waste, as well as the world’s largest stockpile of plutonium. That waste is the product of reactions that drive the UK’s nuclear power stations and it is highly radioactive. It releases energy that can penetrate and damage the cells in our bodies, and ""it remains hazardous for 100,000 years"", explains Claire Corkhill, professor of radioactive waste management at University of Bristol. Sellafield is filling up - and experts say we have no choice but to find somewhere new to keep this material safe. Nuclear power is also part of the government’s stated mission for ”clean power by 2030”. More nuclear power means more nuclear waste. Inside Sellafield’s fuel-handling plant, we watch from behind one metre-thick, lead-lined glass as operators remotely control robotic arms. They manoeuvre joysticks on what look like large retro game-controllers, as the arms pull used nuclear fuel rods – still glowing hot and highly radioactive - from the heavy metal containers in which they arrived. This complex operation never stops. Sellafield runs 24 hours a day with 11,000 staff. It costs more than £2bn per year to keep the site going, and it comprises more than 1,000 buildings, connected by 25 miles of road. However, in recent years, doubts have been raised about the site's security and physical integrity. One of its oldest waste storage silos is currently leaking radioactive liquid into the ground. That is a “recurrence of a historic leak” that Sellafield Ltd, the company that operates the site, says first started in the 1970s. Sellafield has also faced questions about its working culture and adherence to safety rules. The company is currently awaiting sentencing after it pleaded guilty, in June, to charges related to cyber-security failings. An investigation by the Guardian revealed that the site’s systems had been hacked, although the Office for Nuclear Regulation said there was “no evidence that any vulnerabilities had been exploited” by the hackers. All of this has cast a shadow over an operation that, as well as taking in newly created nuclear waste, also houses several decades worth of much older radioactive material. The site no longer produces or reprocesses any nuclear material, but this is where the race began to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons at the height of the Cold War. “It was the dawn of the nuclear age,” says Roddy Miller, Sellafield’s operations director. “But because it was a race, not a lot of thought was given to the long-term safe storage of the waste materials that were produced.” The leaking storage silo, which was built in the 1960s, is just one of the buildings that now has to be emptied so the material inside can go into more modern silos. The building was only ever designed to be filled, and Sellafield says its plans to clear the site and demolish the building are the safest option. The site’s head of retrievals, Alyson Armett, points out that without a “permanent solution” for the nuclear waste, the plans to decommission could be delayed. The current plan for that permanent solution is to bury the waste deep underground. A complicated search – both scientifically and politically - is currently on for somewhere to lock it away from humanity permanently. ""We need to isolate it from future populations or even civilisations, that’s the timescale we’re looking at,"" says Prof Corkhill. She studies how radioactive waste material can be made safe for extremely long-term storage, and is searching for the most stable, inert substance that nuclear waste could be ""baked into"". ""We turn it into a solid - glass, ceramic or a material that’s just like the rocks that the uranium originally came from,"" she explains. At Sellafield, the highest level of radioactive waste is stabilised in a similar way before it is stored on-site. The plan for permanent, underground storage is to contain that solid waste in a Russian doll-like series of barriers. The glass, encased in steel, will be shielded in concrete, then buried beneath the Earth‘s own barriers - layers of solid rock. The question is, where will that facility be? Six years ago, communities in England and Wales were asked to come forward if they were willing to consider having a disposal facility built near their town or village. Potential sites will need the ideal geology - enough solid rock to create that permanent barrier. However, they also need something that might be more difficult - a willing community. There are financial incentives for communities to take part in this discussion. So far, five have come forward. Two have already been ruled out. Allerdale in Cumbria was deemed unsuitable because there was not enough solid bedrock. Then, in September, councillors in South Holderness, in Yorkshire, withdrew after a series of local protests. Government scientists are assessing the remaining three communities that are currently in the running. Geologists have been carrying out seismic testing - looking for that all-important impermeable rock. One of the communities being considered is very close to the Sellafield site in West Cumbria, at Seascale. Local councillor David Moore says the industrial complex is ""just down the road, and it’s the biggest employer in the area"". He adds: “I think that’s why conversation here’s different. We’re already the hosts of the waste. And we all want to find it a safer location. ""I have seven grandchildren who live in this community, and I want them to live in a safe environment.” It is not yet clear if Mid Copeland, the area under consideration that includes Seascale, will have the right rock. The survey and consultation here - and in the other locations being considered - are in their early stages and scheduled to last at least a decade. In the meantime, the conversation goes on and each community being considered for a geological disposal facility (GDF) now receives about £1m a year in investment while initial scientific tests are carried out. Mr Moore is part of a committee called a GDF partnership. It includes local residents, local government and representatives of Nuclear Waste Services, which is the government body behind this project. These partnerships aim to keep the process transparent and ensure local people are well-informed. They also decide how the money is spent. If a GDF is built here, Mr Moore says, there will be billions of pounds invested in the area. “If we're going to host this on behalf of the UK, the community should benefit,” he says. Also still on the shortlist are South Copeland, again on the Cumbrian coast, and a site on the east coast in Lincolnshire, where there have been a number of peaceful, but angry, protests. On Halloween 2021 in Theddlethorpe, one of the local villages, several residents used their gardens to put up garish anti-nuclear dump scarecrows, inspired by an idea from pressure group the Guardians of the East Coast, which is campaigning against the disposal facility. Ken Smith, from nearby Mablethorpe, is a member of both the campaign group and the local GDF partnership. He thinks the government’s approach to finding a nuclear waste disposal site ""stinks"". Mr Smith is concerned that the voices of those most affected might not be heard and says it is unclear how local opinion will be measured at the end of the consultation. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero says a GDF will provide “safe and long-term disposal of the most hazardous radioactive waste”. Prof Corkhill is convinced that a GDF is the safest solution. “We extract uranium from the rocks in the ground, we get energy from them and [this disposal facility essentially means] they’re returned back to the ground again,” she says. “That uranium has been present in those rocks for billions of years. It’s been pushed and pulled, squeezed and heated, exposed to water and air. But the uranium is still safely locked up.” In Finland, a facility, called Onkalo, has already been built, and could receive its first nuclear waste within the next year. Locations for three other sites around the world have also been chosen, in Switzerland, Sweden and France. They are at various stages of development. In the UK, the search, studies and consultations continue. Only when those have been concluded and some kind of final assessment of community support, like a referendum, has taken place will construction of a GDF begin. The earliest that any waste could be put inside it is estimated to be during the 2050s. Until then, it will continue to be stored and managed at Sellafield. “We've benefited from nuclear energy in this country for 70 years, but we are still a long way behind cleaning up the legacy that has been left behind,” says Prof Corkhill. “When we move to thinking about a new generation of nuclear power, we need to think about the waste now.”","Sellafield, in Cumbria, is the temporary home to the vast majority of the UK’s radioactive nuclear waste, as well as the world's largest stockpile of plutonium.

183,2024-09-12 20:17:55,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cged3jd8llyo,Mystery tremors were from massive nine-day tsunami,Climate Change,Public Health & Environment,"A massive landslide in a Greenland fjord triggered a wave that “shook the Earth” for nine days. The seismic signal last September was picked up by sensors all over the world, leading scientists to investigate where it had come from. The landslide - a mountainside of rock that collapsed and carried glacial ice with it - triggered a 200m wave. That wave was then “trapped” in the narrow fjord - moving back and forth for nine days, generating the vibrations. Landslides like this, scientists say, are happening more frequently with climate change - as the glaciers that support Greenland's mountains melt. The results of the investigation into this event, which are published in the journal Science , are the result of a detective mission involving an international team of scientists and the Danish Navy. “When colleagues first spotted this signal last year, it looked nothing like an earthquake. We called it an ‘unidentified seismic object’,” recalled Dr Stephen Hicks from UCL, one of the scientists involved. “It kept appearing - every 90 seconds for nine days.” A group of curious scientists started to discuss the baffling signal on an online chat platform. “At the same time, colleagues from Denmark, who do a lot of fieldwork in Greenland, received reports of a tsunami that happened in a remote fjord,” explained Dr Hicks. “So then we joined forces.” The team used the seismic data to pin down the location of the signal’s source to Dickson Fjord in East Greenland. They then gathered other clues, including satellite imagery and photographs of the fjord that were taken by the Danish Navy just before the signal appeared. A satellite image showed a cloud of dust in a gully in the fjord. Comparing photographs before and after the event revealed that a mountain had collapsed and swept part of a glacier into the water. The researchers eventually worked out that 25 million cubic metres of rock - a volume equivalent of 25 Empire State Buildings - slammed into the water, causing a 200m-high “mega-tsunami”. In the “after” photographs of the location, a mark is visible on the glacier - left by the sediment that the giant wave hurled upwards.  Tsunamis, usually caused by underground earthquakes, dissipate within hours in the open ocean. But this wave was trapped. “This landslide happened about 200km inland from the open ocean,” Dr Hicks explained. “And these fjord systems are really complex, so the wave couldn't dissipate its energy.” The team created a model that showed how, instead of dissipating, it sloshed back and forth for nine days. “We’ve never seen such a large scale movement of water over such a long period,” said Dr Hicks. Scientists say the landslide was caused by rising temperatures in Greenland, which have melted the glacier at the base of the mountain. “That glacier was supporting this mountain, and it got so thin that it just stopped holding it up,” said Dr Hicks. “It shows how climate change is now impacting these areas.” While this event was in a a remote area, these fjords are visited by some Arctic cruise ships. Fortunately none were in the area where this landslide occurred. But the lead researcher, Dr Kristian Svennevig from the National Geological Surveys for Denmark and Greenland (GEUS), said this was an increasingly common phenomenon in the Arctic. “We are witnessing a rise in giant, tsunami-causing landslides, particularly in Greenland,” he told BBC News. “While the Dickson Fjord event alone doesn't confirm this trend, its unprecedented scale underscores the need to carry out more research.” The event at Dickson Fjord, Dr Hicks added, “is the perhaps first time a climate change event has impacted the crust beneath our feet all the world over.”","A massive landslide in a Greenland fjord triggered a wave that “shook the Earth’ for nine days.

567,2024-09-05 11:40:42,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy5dwlwkwro,Anti-pollution law to threaten water bosses with jail,Public Health & Environment,Sustainability,"Water company bosses could be banned from receiving bonuses and even sent to prison under new government legislation to combat pollution. The proposed laws will apply in England and Wales and give increased powers to regulators to tackle companies who pollute and make it easier for them to be fined. Environment Secretary Steve Reed said the measures would “end the disgraceful behaviour of water companies and their bosses”. But some campaigners for cleaner waters have criticised the new legislation, with one telling BBC News it amounted only to “window dressing”. Water companies have been widely criticised for giving multi-million pound pay packages to their executives while continuing to regularly spill sewage into lakes, rivers and the sea. The new Water (Special Measures) Bill will see harsher penalties for law-breaking, with prison sentences of up to two years for executives who fail to cooperate or obstruct investigators. The burden of proof in civil cases will be lowered so that the Environment Agency can more easily bring forward criminal charges against bosses. Regulators will also be given the power to stop bonus payments to water bosses if they fail to meet high standards to protect the environment, their consumers and their company's finances. “Banning the payment of bonuses for bosses who are overseeing failure and making them personally criminally liable if they refuse to comply with investigations will focus them on cleaning up our rivers not lining their pockets,“ Mr Reed said. Some campaigners for cleaner waters told the BBC they were disappointed. Many pointed out that there is already widespread rule-breaking in the water industry and said the real issue was a failure of the water regulator, Ofwat, and the Environment Agency to enforce them properly. Earlier this year a BBC investigation revealed that in 2022 every major English water company reported discharges of raw sewage when the weather was dry – a practice which is potentially illegal. “If the secretary of state believes that the few one-off actions announced today, such as curtailing bosses' bonuses however appealing they may sound are going to fix the underlying causes of our poisoned waterways, then he needs to think again,” Charles Watson of River Action said. He told the BBC Today Programme: ""Finally after years of denial over the whole scandal of the pollution of our rivers lakes and seas we’ve got a government of the day acknowledging the scale of the problem. ""But sadly what we’ve got today is basically a long list of measures that is going to cost the government nothing. They are not really going to fix anything because it’s the system that is broken."" Regarding the threat of jail, Mr Watson said, reflecting on one of the proposed measures listed by the government: ""It's threatening to send them to prison if they obstruct an investigation into lawbreaking, so that’s pretty random. I don't  think anyone will be going to prison."" The Conservatives said the proposed measures were ""simply playing politics"". ""Labour are attempting to pass off measures implemented under the Conservatives - like banning bonuses for water company bosses whose companies who commit serious breaches - as their own,"" said shadow environment minister Robbie Moore. The Liberal Democrats said in a statement: ""On the surface, this new bill simply doesn't look up to scratch to tackling the sewage scandal that has plagued our nation's rivers and waterways. ""Only a complete overhaul of this disgraced industry and a tough new regulator will end the sewage crisis."" Decades of under-investment has left sewage infrastructure frequently unable to cope with the volume of rainwater and sewage, which then leads to spilling. Last year the cumulative spills across England’s sewage network added up to 3.6 million hours. Only 14% of England's rivers are assessed to have good ecological status. Responding to the new legislation a spokesman for Water UK, which represents the water companies, said it agreed the system was “not working”. They called on the regulator Ofwat to back its £105bn five-year investment plan for water and sewage infrastructure. That will ultimately have to be paid for through higher customer bills, and negotiations are continuing with Ofwat as to how much companies will be allowed to put them up by. The new legislation will also give the regulators the power to recover costs from water companies for enforcement action. Ofwat will be required to set rules that ensure companies appoint directors and chief executives, and allow them to remain in post, only when they meet the highest standards of ""fitness and propriety"". The government says there will be more legislation in the future that will make more fundamental changes to the water industry, speed up infrastructure upgrades, deliver reliable water supply and better tackle pollution.","Proposed laws will apply in England and Wales and give increased powers to regulators to tackle companies who pollute.

695,2024-09-01 23:29:13,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkm82enkgko,Striking images reveal depths of Titanic's slow decay,Wildlife & Conservation,Public Health & Environment,"It was the image that made the Titanic's wreck instantly recognisable - the ship's bow looming out of the darkness of the Atlantic depths. But a new expedition has revealed the effects of slow decay, with a large section of railing now on the sea floor. The loss of the railing - immortalised by Jack and Rose in the famous movie scene  - was discovered during a series of dives by underwater robots this summer. The images they captured show how the wreck is changing after more than 100 years beneath the waves. The ship sank in April 1912 after hitting an iceberg, resulting in the loss of 1,500 lives. “The bow of Titanic is just iconic - you have all these moments in pop culture - and that's what you think of when you think of the shipwreck. And it doesn't look like that any more,” said Tomasina Ray, director of collections at RMS Titanic Inc, the company that carried out the expedition. “It's just another reminder of the deterioration that's happening every day. People ask all the time: ‘How long is Titanic going to be there?’ We just don't know but we're watching it in real time.” The team believes the section of railing, which is about 4.5m (14.7ft) long, fell off at some point in the last two years. Images and a digital scan from an 2022 expedition carried out by deep-sea mapping company Magellan and documentary makers Atlantic Productions show that the railing was still attached - though it was starting to buckle. ""At some point the metal gave way and it fell away,"" said Tomasina Ray. It is not the only part of the ship, which lies 3,800m down, that is being lost to the sea. The metal structure is being eaten away by microbes, creating stalactites of rust called rusticles. Previous expeditions have found that parts of the Titanic are collapsing. Dives led by explorer Victor Vescovo in 2019 showed that the starboard side of the officer’s quarters were collapsing, destroying state rooms and obliterating features like the captain’s bath from view. This summer’s RMS Titanic Inc expedition took place over July and August. Two remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) captured more than two million images and 24 hours of high definition footage of both the wreck, which split apart as it sank with the bow and stern lying about 800m apart, and the debris field surrounding it. The company is now carefully reviewing the footage to catalogue the finds and will eventually create a highly detailed digital 3D scan of the entire wreck site. More images from the dives will be revealed over the coming months. The team has also announced another discovery of an artefact they were hoping to find even though it was against all the odds. In 1986 a bronze statue called the Diana of Versailles was spotted and photographed by Robert Ballard, who had found the wreck of the Titanic a year earlier. But its location was not known and the 60cm-tall figure was not documented again. Now, though, it has been discovered lying face up in the sediment in the debris field. ""It was like finding a needle in a haystack, and to rediscover this year was momentous,"" said James Penca, a Titanic researcher and presenter of the Witness Titanic podcast. The statue was once on display for the Titanic’s first-class passengers. ""The first-class lounge was the most beautiful, and unbelievably detailed, room on the ship. And the centrepiece of that room was the Diana of Versailles,"" he said. ""But unfortunately, when Titanic split in two during the sinking, the lounge got ripped open. And in the chaos and the destruction, Diana got ripped off her mantle and she landed in the darkness of the debris field."" RMS Titanic Inc has the salvage rights to the Titanic, and is the only company legally allowed to remove items from the wreck site. Over the years, the company has retrieved thousands of items from the debris field, a selection of which are put on display around the world. They plan to return next year to recover more - and the Diana statue is one of the items they would like to bring back to the surface. But some believe the wreck is a grave site that should be left untouched. ""This rediscovery of the Diana statue is the perfect argument against leaving Titanic alone,"" Mr Penca said in response. ""This was a piece of art that was meant to be viewed and appreciated. And now that beautiful piece of art is on the ocean floor... in pitch black darkness where she has been for 112 years. ""To bring Diana back so people can see her with their own eyes - the value in that, to spark a love of history, of diving, of conservation, of shipwrecks, of sculpture, I could never leave that on the ocean floor.""

As part of the new TB eradication strategy, badgers will be vaccinated instead of killed and work to develop a separate vaccine for livestock will also be stepped up. The government hopes the strategy will deliver its target to eradicate the disease in England by 2038. While campaigners Badger Trust criticised the government for allowing culling already licensed this year to go ahead, the National Farmers Union said culling had  worked against TB and shouldn't be ruled out. The government said its new strategy will deliver its manifesto pledge to end the “ineffective” culling of badgers. It has set a target to end all culling by the end of this Parliament, which could be in 2029. Daniel Zeichner, minister for food security and rural affairs, said the disease had “devastated British farmers and wildlife for far too long”. “Our comprehensive TB eradication package will allow us to end the badger cull by the end of this parliament and stop the spread of this horrific disease,” he added. Over the past decade, outbreaks of the bovine tuberculosis have seen more than 278,000 cattle compulsorily slaughtered, according to the government. It also says 230,000 badgers have been killed in efforts to control the disease. It costs taxpayers more than £100m every year to deal with outbreaks. Under the new strategy, a “badger vaccinator field force” will be set up to increase the number of badgers vaccinated. The impact of those vaccinations will be analysed to see if it affects the incidence of bTB in cattle and badgers will be monitored to find out the prevalence of the disease in the population. In the meantime, work on the development of a vaccine in cattle itself will be stepped up, with field trials undertaken in the coming months. Christine Middlemiss, the government’s chief veterinary officer, said there was no single way to combat bovine tuberculosis and that the new strategy would “continue to be led by the very best scientific and epidemiological evidence”. The first badger population survey in over a decade will also be carried out to establish current numbers and the impact of widespread culling over the past decade. But Badger Trust said the government needed to do more to stop the transmission of the disease between cattle on farms themselves. The trust said tens of thousands of badgers could still be culled this year under existing licences that the government has said it will honour. Peter Hambly, the trust’s chief executive said: “The new announcement on bovineTB keeps badgers in the firing line. “It focuses on badgers rather than cattle - when it is cattle that are the main spreaders of this cattle disease. “It admits the government doesn’t know how many badgers are left or how many even have bTB.  They haven’t counted them and haven’t tested them but continue to slaughter them.” The National Farmers Union cautioned in a statement that while vaccination trials were encouraging: ""Badger culling provides success and has a part to play in a strategy where there is evidence that it is the right tool to contain and reduce TB."" “I urge Ministers to move at pace and with a clear view of the science,"" said NFU President Tom Bradshaw. ""This terrible disease continues to plague farmers and their livestock, and while significant elements of the government’s proposed TB strategy are still being researched and are not yet deployable at scale, they must not overlook the contribution of the tried, tested and successful disease control model."" ","Badgers will be vaccinated instead of killed as part of new TB eradication strategy. Work to develop a separate vaccine for livestock will also be stepped up.

951,2024-08-29 04:27:17,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yk398g9dlo,Baby boom prompts call to boost wild beaver population,Wildlife & Conservation,Sustainability,"A network of wildlife charities is calling for beavers to be released into rivers across England and Wales in the wake of a kit baby boom. The beaver is a keystone species that can bring huge benefits to nature but governments are stalling on plans to reintroduce them into the wild, the Wildlife Trusts say. They want the governments in England and Wales to publish strategies for returning beavers to their natural habitats and for “illegal” wild populations to be allowed to stay. This summer has seen an upsurge in sightings of baby beavers. Kits have been seen swimming on rivers in Kent and there has been a crop of births in fenced enclosures at nature reserves. Scientific studies showed beavers could improve water quality, help alleviate flooding and drought, and give a huge boost to habitats and other wildlife, the Wildlife Trusts' landscape-recovery director, Rob Stoneman, said. “Nature needs beavers – but at the moment, these extraordinary mammals are either confined to enclosures where the benefits to communities are limited or they’ve been released illegally and there are no management plans in place to support land managers,” he said. Beavers cannot be legally released into the wild, except in Scotland. Beavers disappeared from Britain about 400 years ago, after being hunted to extinction for their meat and fur. But in the past few decades, the semi-aquatic animals have sprung up in fenced enclosures on nature reserves or been found living in rivers through unlicensed releases and escapes. There are thought to be hundreds of wild beavers living “illegally” in English rivers and more than 1,000 in Scotland. This summer, beavers were born in enclosures from Ealing, west London, to the Wallington Estate, in Northumberland, on rivers in Canterbury, Kent, and at the Cairngorms, in the Highlands. Beavers were acknowledged as a native species in England in 2022, paving the way for reintroductions - but no strategy has been announced, despite a three-year consultation and encouraging signs from ministers. In England, there is one “official” population of beavers, on the river Otter, in Devon, where escapees were given permission to stay. Elsewhere, wild populations are caught in a “limbo”. A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs official said: “This government is absolutely committed to restoring and protecting nature and we support species reintroductions where there are clear benefits for nature, people and the environment. “We will continue to work with Natural England to develop our approach to beaver reintroductions in England.” But some farmers and landowners oppose reintroductions, because wild beavers can damage crops and cause localised flooding. Successful reintroductions required a process “to support communities to live alongside beavers”, Devon Wildlife Trust nature-recovery director Pete Burgess said. And this included rewarding landowners who made space for beavers, through agri-environment schemes. In Wales, beavers have not yet been recognised as a native species, meaning they are not formally protected.","Kits have been seen swimming on rivers in Kent and there has been a crop of births in fenced enclosures at nature reserves.

1079,2024-08-18 23:24:41,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkm2vpy7g6o,Why the skies turned red over the UK this weekend,Climate Change,Public Health & Environment,"Smoke from wildfires across the Atlantic has brought spectacular vivid colours to sunsets and sunrises across the UK this weekend. Fires have blazed across North America this summer, and smoke particles have been carried by the jet stream to the skies above the British Isles. The unusual hues should continue until Monday, when more unsettled weather will begin to disperse the smoke in the upper atmosphere. But skywatchers could also be in for a treat on Monday night, when a rare blue supermoon appears above the UK. A jet stream is a high altitude current of air that occurs when warmer air from the south meets cooler air from the north, and is responsible for much of the UK's climate. This makes the sky look more orange, BBC forecaster Gareth Burleigh-Harvey says, as the smoke particles diffuse the sunlight. This can lead to more vivid sunsets and sunrises which is what happened over Saturday and Sunday, he says, and will continue until Monday evening. There is a sepia effect from the red, brown and orange hues which can make for more dramatic views. Because the smoke is high up, there is no risk to people's health and the haze is expected to have moved on by Tuesday morning. The UK skies will play host to a rare lunar phenomenon on Monday night - a blue super moon. Monday's full moon is not just a supermoon. It is also a blue moon but those hoping to see a bluish shade to the satellite are out of luck. A blue moon refers to the third full moon in a season with four full moons, as is the case with this full moon. It can also refer to the second full moon in a month with two full moons. A supermoon appears brighter and bigger than usual because the Moon's orbit brings it closer to earth. The last time the UK witnessed a combined super blue moon was last August - but if you miss it, the next one is reportedly not due until 2037.","Smoke from wildfires across the Atlantic has brought vivid colours to sunsets and sunrises across the UK this weekend. Fires have blazed across North America this summer, and smoke particles have been carried by the jet stream to the skies above the British Isles. The unusual hues should continue until Monday, when more unsettled weather will begin to disperse the smoke in the upper atmosphere. But skywatchers could also be in for a treat on Monday night, when a rare blue supermoon appears above the UK.",http://res.cloudinary.com/drwsupfyj/image/upload/v1728698489/state-of-the-earth/news_photographs/whytheskiesturnedredovertheukthisweekend.jpg
1207,2024-08-19 11:05:27,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly37q7qqyzo,Brian May argues for better farm hygiene to protect badgers,Public Health & Environment,Society & Culture,"Queen guitarist Sir Brian May says new research shows cattle could be passing bovine tuberculosis (bTB) between themselves, and that badgers are not a significant factor in the spread of the disease. Sir Brian, 77, helped conduct the research presented in a new BBC documentary , and says his campaigning against badger culling to tackle bTB ""has become as important to me as music"". Cattle are regularly tested and destroyed if the disease is found, with more than 50,000 slaughtered in the UK between April last year and March this year. A leading vet said Sir Brian's findings could not be viewed in isolation, while a farmer who has lost 500 of his herd to the disease said badgers ""do contribute"" to the bTB problem. After the commissioned research which took more than 10 years, Sir Brian said he believes that improving farm hygiene could help to provide a solution to the problem of bTB. ""The spread of bTB is from cow to cow and it’s because of inefficient hygiene situations. Biosecurity in the old days meant keeping the badgers out but now means keeping the slurry away from the cows so they can’t infect each other,"" Sir Brian said. After working with farms in Wales and England, he concluded that the pathogen which caused the spread of bTB was present in large quantities in the faeces of cattle which can contaminate food and water for the animals. ""At the root of it all there are certain principles which need to be followed which are really keeping the pathogen from progressing throughout a herd, cutting off its line of transmission,"" Sir Brian said. ""Everything is within the herd."" Sir Brian said he didn't blame the farming community for the ""suspicion and hostility"" he had experienced upon presenting his ideas to them, but said he thought his team could ""make a change and offer hope"". ""We’ve been 12 years on this trail and we’ve made discoveries which no-one else has made,"" he said. ""Speaking out against the culling of badgers has become as important to me as music."" But Wales' former chief veterinary officer Christianne Glossop said that while slurry management was important in tackling bTB, it was hard to achieve on some farms and should not be viewed in isolation. Prof Glossop, the new chair of the Royal Veterinary College's Animal Care Trust, said: ""TB can arrive on a farm through an infected animal, through dirty boots being walked on to a farm, indeed the possibility of infected slurry being spread in the fields next door. ""It’s also possible that other infected species, including the badger, may introduce infection onto a farm."" Working with vet Dick Sibley at Gatcombe Farm in Devon, Sir Brian's research suggested that the standard bTB skin test did not detect all instances of the disease in cattle that could be captured with enhanced testing. As a result, he said herds or bulls that were considered bTB-free could in fact have been spreading the disease. While analysing cattle faeces, the bTB pathogen M. Bovis was found. The farm introduced a new hygiene regime, to keep the faeces from contaminating living areas, food and water. After four years in 2019, the farm became officially bTB-free. Although there were subsequent outbreaks in 2020 and 2023, the farm's herd is currently again bTB-free. Prof Glossop paid tribute to Sir Brian's work, but added: ""Did that case study prove that badgers have no role to play in the bovine TB equation? No, I don’t agree with that conclusion."" Farmer Chris Mossman has had more than 500 cows destroyed after testing positive for bTB at his farm in Llangrannog, Ceredigion, since 2016. ""It’s very interesting what Brian May and Dick Sibley have done, but my opinion of TB is that it’s a very complex, complicated disease,"" he said. ""It’s running rings around all of us because the situation is not improving. My way of thinking is, pursue it, let’s roll out onto other farms to see if they have an equal level of success with it, but we can’t put all our eggs in one basket."" Mr Mossman said dealing with bTB in his herd had taken a toll on his mental health and following testing procedures and biosecurity measures required of him and his staff ""imposed almost another job on top of our daily job just to cope with this disease"". A trial badger cull was established in the 1990s to assess its effectiveness in controlling bTB. Lord John Krebs, who was behind that 10-year scientific trial, told the programme: ""If you really want to control TB in cattle then killing badgers is not going to be a terribly effective policy."" In 2011, the UK government decided to cull badgers in TB hotspots in England because - after re-interpreting the Krebs evidence - it concluded badgers could be contributing to the spread of bovine TB. Farm industry board the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board said: “Evidence from cull areas proves that there is a strong link between badger populations carrying the infection and the spread of the disease to cattle. “Data from the first 52 cull areas, collected by the APHA (animal and plant health agency), also shows that rates of bovine TB breakdowns in cattle are down on average by 56% after four years of culling badgers. This analysis has been published in the scientific journal Nature after rigorous peer review.” Between April 2023 and March 2024, more than 21,000 cattle were slaughtered in England after bTB was found, with 11,197 animals killed in Wales and 18,577 in Northern Ireland. Scotland is officially bTB free and incidence is very low. Labour pledged before last month's general election to look at new ways to tackle bTB spread ""so that we can end the ineffective badger cull"". The UK government said it was working towards a situation where badger culling could be ended in England. ""We recognise the devastating impact bovine TB has on the farming community which is why we are committed to beating this insidious disease,"" said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. ""This government will roll out a TB eradication package including vaccination, herd management and biosecurity measures to achieve our objective of getting to bovine TB free status and end the badger cull."" Of the 11,000 cattle killed in Wales last year, nearly 40% were in Pembrokeshire. Last week, the Welsh government established a board in an attempt to reach a TB-free Wales. The Welsh government said it was ""very aware of the distressing impact of bovine TB on the health and well-being of our farmers and their families and we are absolutely determined to eradicate this devastating disease"".

1366,2024-08-16 21:04:43,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1d77yq9zz2o,UK military satellite launches to boost space power,Technology & Science,Politics & Law,"The UK military has launched its first ever dedicated Earth-imaging satellite. Called Tyche, the washing machine-sized spacecraft will have sufficient resolution to identify battlefield troop positions and vehicles. It's a demonstrator that should be followed by a network of satellites this decade using a variety of sensors. Some of these future spacecraft will be able to see through cloud and even eavesdrop on radio transmissions. Tyche's ride to orbit was booked on a SpaceX Falcon rocket flying out of California. Lift-off occurred  at 11:56 local time (19:56 BST). The British mission will circle the globe at an altitude of roughly 500km, where it's expected to operate for at least five years. UK forces have long benefited from the use of their own, state-of-the-art satellite communications system, called Skynet , but getting access to surveillance and reconnaissance imagery from space has largely required a friendly request to allies, particularly the United States. And while the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has contributed funds in the past to projects in the UK commercial sector, Tyche will be its first wholly owned imaging capability. Commissioned by UK Space Command and built by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL) in Guildford, the 160kg satellite will collect its imagery at optical wavelengths - in the same light we sense with our eyes. It's designed to capture 5km-wide spot scenes on the ground and have a best resolution of 90cm. This is by no means the best performance possible (some classified US satellites are reported to see features as small as 10cm across ), but it fits with the British military's generalised needs. Tyche was born out of a 2021 Space Command Paper and a 2022 Space Defence Strategy , which committed the last government to spend £970m over 10 years on a programme called Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, and Reconnaissance, or ISTARI. This set out a number of initial R&D efforts with the eventual goal of launching a sovereign constellation of military and national security satellites to orbit. These spacecraft are intended to carry a range of technologies, among them radar sensors that can see the Earth's surface in all weathers and at night - a capability Ukraine has found invaluable in tracking invading Russian forces. ""This is the start of a journey,"" said Maj Gen Paul Tedman, commander of UK Space Command. ""The space defence strategy lays out how we're going to become a meaningful space power by 2030. ""We're hoping to see many more launches of satellites in the coming months and years. Tyche is absolutely the beginning of that.” SSTL has been working closely with UK Space Command on ISTARI and hopes to win further defence contracts, at home and abroad. ""Many other countries are setting up space commands,"" said Darren Jones, the manufacturer's head of defence business. ""There's lots of appetite around the world for space capabilities for defence purposes. What this Tyche contract shows for us is that we've got confidence from the MoD to deliver these types of missions, which can only help us in future with other nations around the globe."" Tyche is based on the company's Carbonite model , which can be assembled rapidly and at relatively low cost (the Tyche contract is worth £22m). One interesting feature is its propulsion system which manoeuvres the satellite using water. ""The water goes through a thruster that heats it up to make superheated steam. That's how we get thrust and do station-keeping,"" explained chief technology officer Andrew Haslehurst. ""Tyche carries 10 litres. It's enough to get five-to seven years of in-orbit life."" Shortly after the Defence Space Strategy was published, the then Commons Defence Select Committee criticised the UK for being, ""at best, a third-rank space power"" . Britain is the only G8 nation without a sovereign satellite imaging capability. The committee raised specific concern for ISTARI's future prospects, given the MoD's ""woeful track record in delivering major projects on time and to budget"". A new government was elected in July, of course, and immediately initiated a root and branch review of UK defence needs and spending. With other countries highlighting the growing importance of the space domain in future conflicts, it seems unlikely the latest UK defence assessment will tack a different course to the last one. But policy experts would be watching closely, said Julia Balm, research associate at the Freeman Air and Space Institute, King's College London. ""I think if there's anything negative on ISTARI or there are any cutbacks when it comes to things that have already been committed in strategies, then that's just indicative of the UK's inability to deliver any sort of long-term or large-scale project. And it also doesn't really hold a good message about the UK being committed to growing as a space power,"" she told BBC News.","Washing machine-sized spacecraft will have sufficient resolution to identify battlefield troop positions and vehicles.

1494,2024-08-16 07:07:15,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9l2mrn43jo,Scottish isles may solve mystery of 'Snowball Earth',Climate Change,Technology & Science,"A cluster of Scottish islands could help solve one of our planet's greatest mysteries, scientists say. The Garvellach islands off the west coast of Scotland are the best record of Earth entering its biggest ever ice age around 720 million years ago, researchers have discovered. The big freeze, which covered nearly all the globe in two phases for 80 million years, is known as ""Snowball Earth"", after which the first animal life emerged. Clues hidden in rocks about the freeze have been wiped out everywhere - except in the Garvellachs. Researchers hope the islands will tell us why Earth went into such an extreme icy state for so long and why it was necessary for complex life to emerge. Layers of rock can be thought of as pages of a history book – with each layer containing details of the Earth’s condition in the distant past. But the critical period leading up to Snowball Earth was thought to be missing because the rock layers were eroded by the big freeze. Now a new study by researchers at University College, London, has revealed that the Garvellachs somehow escaped unscathed. It may be the only place on Earth to have a detailed record of how the Earth entered one of the most catastrophic periods in its history – as well as what happened when the first animal life emerged when the snowball thawed hundreds of millions of years ago. Back then Scotland was in a completely different place because the continents have moved over time. It was south of the Earth’s equator and had a tropical climate, until it and the rest of the planet became engulfed in ice. “We capture that moment of entering an ice age in Scotland that is missing in all other localities in the world,” Prof Graham Shields of University College London, who led the research, told BBC News. “Millions of critical years are missing in other places because of glacial erosion – but it is all there in the layers of rock in the Garvellachs.” The islands in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland are uninhabited, apart from a team of scientists working out of the main island's solitary building, although there are also the ruins of a 6th Century Celtic monastery. The breakthrough was made by Prof Shield’s PhD student, Elias Rugen, whose results have been published in the Journal of the Geological Society of London. Elias is the first to date the rock layers and identify them as from the critical period that is missing from all other rock formations in all other parts of the world. His discovery puts the Garvellachs in line for one of the biggest accolades in science: the golden spike hammered in at locations identified as the best record of planet-changing geological moments – though to ward off thieves the spike is not actually made of gold. Elias has taken many of the judges of the golden spike, formally known as members of the “Cryogenian sub-commission”, several times to the rock faces to press his case. The next stage is to allow the wider geological community to voice any objections or to come up with a better candidate. If there are none, then the spike could be hammered in next year. The prize would raise the scientific profile of the location and attract further research funding. If it does earn the prize it would delight the man who first identified the significance of the formation as a young researcher 60 years ago, Dr Tony Spencer. “There are about fifty places in where we could choose for this golden spike,""he told BBC News, ""but this is the one where the rocks are thickest and the sedimentation is the most continuous. ""So it appears to preserve the very earliest point in time when there is a record of this particular ice age.”","Garvellach islands off the west coast of Scotland are the best record of Earth entering its biggest ever ice age around 720 million years ago.

1622,2024-08-07 17:29:30,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0ngx130kxo,400-year record heat threat to Great Barrier Reef,Climate Change,Public Health & Environment,"A study of samples taken from inside the bodies of centuries-old coral has revealed the threat climate change now poses to the Great Barrier Reef. Researchers in Australia say temperatures in and around the vast coral reef over the past decade are the highest recorded in 400 years. Extreme heat has already caused five mass bleaching events in the past nine years alone. Writing in the journal Nature , the scientists behind the study say increased temperatures, driven by climate change, now pose an “existential threat” to this natural wonder of the world. “The science tells us that the Great Barrier Reef is in danger - and we should be guided by the science,” Prof Helen McGregor, from the University of Wollongong, told BBC News. The new evidence comes from within the coral itself. Over many years, marine scientists have collected cores - samples drilled out of the skeletons of coral -  which provide chemical clues about how the environment around the reef has changed as the coral developed. Coral - which are animals, not plants - can live for centuries, laying down chemical indicators about their natural environment. Researchers in Australia re-examined the data from thousands of these cores and cross-referenced them with historical sea temperature records from the UK’s Hadley Centre. The research showed temperatures around the Great Barrier Reef in the previous decade were the warmest of the past 400 years. ""The recent events in the Great Barrier Reef are extraordinary,” said lead researcher Dr Benjamin Henley, who carried out the study whilst working at Wollongong University. “Unfortunately, this is terrible news for the reef."" “There is still a glimmer of hope though,"" he added. ""If we can come together and restrict global warming, then there's a glimmer of hope for this reef, and others around the world, to survive in their current state.” Corals have adapted to survive and grow within a specific temperature range - forming a skeleton that provides a living habitat for other marine life. Corals exist in a symbiotic partnership with a special type of marine plant - a species of algae -  which lives inside the coral, providing it with food and giving it its bright colour. Bleaching occurs when sea temperatures rise too high and corals expel their algae, subsequently turning white. “It’s not a pretty sight,” said Dr Henley. “Eventually [other] algae grows on the surface of the white coral, turning it brown. ""While bleached coral can recover, if the heat does not relent, it doesn’t have the chance to,"" he explained. “I'm a little reluctant to say things are doomed,” said Prof McGregor. ""Reefs have survived a lot of change over geological time. So I guess the question comes down to -  what kind of reef do we end up with? “It won't be like what we have now.” The Great Barrier Reef is currently a Unesco World Heritage site . Scientists hope that this research could persuade the UN organisation to change its mind and give the reef official “endangered” status. Prof McGregor said this “would send a huge signal to the world about how grave the problem is”. ""We know what we need to do,” she added. “We have international agreements in place [to limit global temperature rise]. ""I think we just need to put the politics aside and get on with it.""","Temperatures in and around the Great Barrier Reef over the past decade are the highest recorded in 400 years.

The proposal will now go to public consultation and is part of Ofwat's largest ever investigation into water company performance. The announcement comes amid growing public anger over the environmental and financial performance of some water companies. Sewage spills into England's rivers and seas more than doubled last year. Ofwat's investigation has looked into whether the three companies have been providing customers with the level of service they are entitled to under the law. It has found the three companies failed to adequately invest in and maintain their networks, leading to repeated releases of raw sewage into the country’s waterways. On Tuesday it proposed fines of  £47m for Yorkshire Water and £17m for Northumbrian Water. For Thames Water it is proposing the largest fine on record of £104m. The regulator's chief executive, David Black, said: “Ofwat has uncovered a catalogue of failure by Thames Water, Yorkshire Water and Northumbrian Water in how they ran their sewage works and this resulted in excessive spills."" This announcement follows a BBC investigation earlier this year that revealed sewage had potentially been released illegally 6,000 times in 2022 by England's water companies in breach of their permits. Releasing raw sewage has the potential to significantly damage the environment and poses a risk to human health for those swimming in a river or sea where sewage is being discharged. Ofwat can fine companies up to 10% of their annual sales. In the case of Thames Water, the proposed fine is 9% of sales, which Mr Black told the BBC ""reflects the severity of the offences"". The regulator found that more than two-thirds of Thames Water's wastewater treatment works had operational issues, and that most of Yorkshire Water's wastewater treatment works had regularly spilled sewage into the environment since 2018 pointing to a ""systematic issue"". A Thames Water spokesperson said: ""We take this matter very seriously and have cooperated at every stage of Ofwat’s investigation. We regard all untreated discharges as unacceptable, even when they are permitted."" Yorkshire Water and Northumbrian Water said they were disappointed by Ofwat's decision. Ofwat continues its investigations into a further eight water and wastewater companies in England and Wales for similar issues, with further updates expected in the coming year. ""For too long, failure to invest in our vital water infrastructure has been unchecked,"" said Tessa Wardley, director of advocacy at environmental charity Rivers Trust. ""It seems highly likely that there is more to come when investigations into the other eight water companies is concluded."" Water companies have been proposing to raise customer bills by more than 44% over the next five years to pay for improvements in water infrastructure. Thames has argued for an increase of £191 over the next five years but Ofwat has only agreed to £99. But there has been concern from environmental campaigners that the money from customers’ bills is not being sufficiently invested in upgrades and they have called for a ban on executive bonuses . The government is currently consulting on plans to ensure that money earmarked for upgrades cannot be used to pay salaries or dividends. On Tuesday, Environment Secretary Steve Reed said: “I welcome Ofwat’s action today. The unacceptable destruction of our waterways should never have been allowed - and it is right that those responsible for illegally polluting our rivers, lakes and seas face the consequences. “This government will fundamentally reform the water sector."" The threat of fresh fines will raise questions about how much some companies can afford to invest in infrastructure upgrades. Thames Water has been struggling with debts of £14.7bn. It announced last month it only had enough cash to fund operations until the end of May 2025 - and was already at risk of having the credit rating of its debts downgraded. Colm Gibson, a former water industry executive, and now managing director at consultancy Berkeley Research Group told the BBC: ""Thames is in a particularly precarious financial position and it’s trying to negotiate for more equity to come in to sort itself out. ""And if it has to pay this fine on top of all the others, that just makes the task harder, and its already a difficult task."" The companies can appeal, and Ofwat can reduce the fine if the water firms demonstrate they are taking measures to tackle sewage discharges.","Thames Water, Yorkshire Water and Northumbrian Water face £168m fines over historic sewage spills.

Rory Golden was on the Oceangate expedition when contact with the sub and its five passengers was lost on a dive to the Titanic in June 2023. “We had this image in our heads of them being down there, running out of oxygen in the freezing cold, getting terribly frightened and scared,” he said. But after learning the sub had imploded just hours into the dive, he said it was a comfort to know those onboard hadn’t suffered. Mr Golden was on the Polar Prince support ship to give presentations about the Titanic when the submersible went missing. “When the sub was overdue we weren't unduly concerned because communications break down a lot in the ocean,” he explained. “But when the alarm was finally raised, that's when we realised that there were some serious issues.” A major search and rescue operation was launched by the US Coast Guard. A few days in, underwater sounds detected by search aircraft raised hopes that these were coming from the missing sub. But it's now known that those onboard most likely died instantly after Titan suffered a catastrophic failure as it neared the Titanic at the bottom of the Atlantic. “We lived in false hope for four days,” Mr Golden said. “There’s still a lot of questions to be answered.” Those who perished were British explorer Hamish Harding, the British-Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman, Stockton Rush, the CEO of Oceangate, and French diver Paul Henri - or PH - Nargeolet. Rory Golden was a close friend of PH - a veteran deep sea explorer. He is now on the first expedition to the Titanic since the tragedy -  an expedition that  PH Nargeolet was supposed to be leading. A plaque is being laid in his honour at the wreck site and a memorial service for all those who died on the sub has been held at sea. Mr Golden told the BBC he was one of the last people to see PH alive. “He left the ship in great spirits, in great form and he was happy. He was going somewhere that he wanted to be.” Rory Golden had also visited the Titanic on the Oceangate sub. ”PH and I had discussed the submersible in the past and I had actually made a dive in it myself the year before,” he said. “And I'm here - as are many others. The Titan sub had made 15 dives to the Titanic up to that point, so it had worked. “I was comfortable, I spent 12 hours at the Titanic and it was a whole different experience being in a submersible that I could actually move around quite well in.” He told the BBC that he didn’t regret his dive at all. “It wasn't my time,” he said. “You never know when your time is going to come. And that certainly brought that home to all of us.” The discovery of the wreckage of Titan four days after it went missing confirmed the fate of those onboard. “We all cried when the remains were found of the sub,” he said. “A special bond has been formed between all of us who were there on the ship that week. And that's a bond that will always be there.” Industry experts had raised many serious questions about the safety of the Titan submersible prior to the dive. Investigations by the US Coast Guard and Canadian Coast Guard are still ongoing. They are likely to call for changes to ensure such a tragedy doesn’t happen again.",Rory Golden was on the Polar Prince support ship when the sub went missing.

2006,2024-08-04 01:05:44,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd168081wxvo,World's biggest iceberg spins in ocean trap,Wildlife & Conservation,Public Health & Environment,"Something remarkable has happened to A23a, the world's biggest iceberg. For months now it has been spinning on the spot just north of Antarctica when really it should be racing along with Earth's most powerful ocean current. Scientists say the frozen block, which is more than twice the size of Greater London, has been captured on top of a huge rotating cylinder of water. It's a phenomenon oceanographers call a Taylor Column - and it's possible A23a might not escape its jailer for years. ""Usually you think of icebergs as being transient things; they fragment and melt away. But not this one,"" observed polar expert Prof Mark Brandon. ""A23a is the iceberg that just refuses to die,"" the Open University researcher told BBC News. The berg's longevity is well documented. It broke free from the Antarctic coastline way back in 1986, but then almost immediately got stuck in the bottom-muds of the Weddell Sea. For three decades it was a static ""ice island"". It didn't budge. It wasn't until 2020 that it re-floated and started to drift again, slowly at first, before then charging north towards warmer air and waters. In early April this year, A23a stepped into the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) - a juggernaut that moves a hundred times as much water around the globe as all Earth's rivers combined. This was meant to put boosters on the near-trillion-tonne berg, rifling it up into the South Atlantic and certain oblivion. Instead, A23a went precisely nowhere. It remains in place just north of South Orkney Islands, turning in an anti-clockwise direction by about 15 degrees a day. And as long as it does this, its decay and eventual demise will be delayed. A23a has not grounded again; there is at least a thousand metres of water between its underside and the seafloor. It's been stopped in its tracks by a type of vortex first described in the 1920s by a brilliant physicist, Sir G.I. (Geoffrey Ingram) Taylor . The Cambridge academic was a pioneer in the field of fluid dynamics, and was even brought into the Manhattan Project to model the likely stability of the world's first atomic bomb test. Prof Taylor showed how a current that meets an obstruction on the seafloor can - under the right circumstances - separate into two distinct flows, generating a full-depth mass of rotating water between them. In this instance, the obstruction is a 100km-wide bump on the ocean bottom known as Pirie Bank. The vortex sits on top of the bank, and for now A23a is its prisoner. ""The ocean is full of surprises, and this dynamical feature is one of the cutest you'll ever see,"" said Prof Mike Meredith from the British Antarctic Survey. ""Taylor Columns can also form in the air; you see them in the movement of clouds above mountains. They can be just a few centimetres across in an experimental laboratory tank or absolutely enormous as in this case where the column has a giant iceberg slap-bang in the middle of it."" How long might A23a continue to perform its spinning-top routine? Who knows, but when Prof Meredith placed a scientific buoy in a Taylor Column above another bump to the east of Pirie Bank, the floating instrument was still rotating in place four years later . A23a is a perfect illustration once again of the importance of understanding the shape of the seafloor. Submarine mountains, canyons and slopes have a profound influence on the direction and mixing of waters, and on the distribution of the nutrients that drive biological activity in the ocean. And this influence extends also to the climate system: it's the mass movement of water that helps disperse heat energy around the globe. A23a's behaviour can be explained because the ocean bottom just north of South Orkney is reasonably well surveyed. That's not the case for much of the rest of the world. Currently, only a quarter of Earth's seafloor has been mapped to the best modern standard. An earlier version of this story contained an illustrative map of the English Channel containing an iceberg that was slightly over-sized. This has now been amended.","A23a is more than twice the size of Greater London. It broke free from the Antarctic coastline way back in 1986. But it got stuck in the bottom-muds of the Weddell Sea.

2262,2024-09-15 15:44:52,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3dv0ddwp7o,Astronauts reveal what life is like on ISS – and how they deal with 'space smell',Technology & Science,Public Health & Environment,"In June two American astronauts left Earth expecting to spend eight days on the International Space Station (ISS). But after fears that their Boeing Starliner spacecraft was unsafe to fly back on, Nasa delayed Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore’s return until 2025 . They are now sharing a space about the size of a six-bedroom house with nine other people. Ms Williams calls it her ""happy place"" and Mr Wilmore says he is ""grateful"" to be there. But how does it really feel to be 400km above Earth? How do you deal with tricky crewmates? How do you exercise and wash your clothes? What do you eat - and, importantly, what is the “space smell”? Talking to BBC News, three former astronauts divulge the secrets to surviving in orbit. Every five minutes of the astronauts’ day is divided up by mission control on Earth. They wake early. At around 06:30 GMT, astronauts emerge from the phone-booth size sleeping quarter in the ISS module called Harmony. “It has the best sleeping bag in the world,” says Nicole Stott, an American astronaut with Nasa who spent 104 days in space on two missions in 2009 and 2011. The compartments have laptops so crew can stay in contact with family and a nook for personal belongings like photographs or books. The astronauts might then use the bathroom, a small compartment with a suction system. Normally sweat and urine is recycled into drinking water but a fault on the ISS means the crew must currently store urine instead. Then the astronauts get to work. Maintenance or scientific experiments take up most time on the ISS, which is about the size of Buckingham Palace - or an American football field. “Inside it's like many buses all bolted together. In half a day you might never see another person,” explains Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, commander on the Expedition 35 mission in 2012-13. “People just don't go zipping through the station. It’s big and it's peaceful,” he says. The ISS has six dedicated labs for experiments, and astronauts wear heart, brain or blood monitors to measure their responses to the challenging physical environment. “We’re guinea pigs,” says Ms Stott, adding that “space puts your bones and muscles into an accelerated ageing process, and scientists can learn from that”. If the astronauts can, they work faster than mission control predicts. Mr Hadfield explains: ""Your game is to find five free minutes. I would float to the window to watch something go by. Or write music, take photographs or write something for my children."" A lucky few are asked to do a spacewalk, leaving the ISS for the space vacuum outside. Mr Hadfield has done two. “Those 15 hours outside, with nothing between me and the universe but my plastic visor, was as stimulating and otherworldly as any other 15 hours of my life."" But that spacewalk can introduce something novel to the space station - the metallic “space smell”. “On Earth we have lots of different smells, like washing machine laundry or fresh air. But in space there’s just one smell, and we get used to it quickly,” explains Helen Sharman, the first British astronaut, who spent eight days on the Soviet space station Mir in 1991. Objects that go outside, like a suit or scientific kit, are affected by the strong radiation of space. “Radiation forms free radicals on the surface, and they react with oxygen inside the space station, creating a metallic smell,” she says. When she returned to Earth, she valued sensory experiences much more. “There’s no weather in space - no rain on your face and or wind in your hair. I appreciate those so much more to this day now,” she says, 33 years later. In between working, astronauts on long stays must do two hours of exercise daily. Three different machines help to counter the effect of living in zero gravity, which reduces bone density. The Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) is good for squats, deadlifts, and rows that work all the muscle groups, says Ms Stott. Crew use two treadmills that they must strap into to stop themselves floating away, and a cycle ergometer for endurance training. All that work creates a lot of sweat, Ms Stott says, leading to a very important issue - washing. “We don't have laundry - just water that forms into blobs and some soapy stuff,"" she explains. Without gravity pulling sweat off the body, the astronauts get covered in a coating of sweat - ""way more than on Earth"", she says. ""I would feel the sweat growing on my scalp - I had to swab down my head. You wouldn't want to shake it because it just would fly everywhere."" Those clothes become so dirty that they are thrown out in a cargo vehicle that burns up in the atmosphere. But their daily clothes stay clean, she says. “In zero-gravity, clothes float on the body so oils and everything else don’t affect them. I had one pair of trousers for three months,” she explains. Instead food was the biggest hazard. “Somebody would open up a can, for example, meats and gravy,” she says. “Everybody was on alert because little balls of grease drifted out. People floated backwards, like in the Matrix film, to dodge the balls of meat juice.” At some point another craft might arrive, bringing a new crew or supplies of food, clothes, and equipment. Nasa sends a few supply vehicles a year. Arriving at the space station from Earth is “amazing”, says Mr Hadfield. “It’s a life-changing moment when you catch sight of the ISS there in the eternity of the universe - seeing this little bubble of life, a microcosm of human creativity in the blackness,” he says. After a hard day’s work, it is time for dinner. Food is mostly reconstituted in packets, separated into different compartments by nation. “It was like camping food or military rations. Good but it could be healthier,” Ms Stott says. “My favourite was Japanese curries, or Russian cereal and soups,” she says. Families send their loved ones bonus food packs. “My husband and son picked little treats, like chocolate-covered ginger,” she says. The crew share their food most of the time. Astronauts are pre-selected for personal attributes - tolerant, laid-back, calm - and trained to work as a team. That reduces the likelihood of conflict, explains Ms Sharman. “It’s not just about putting up with somebody's bad behaviour, but calling it out. And we always give each other metaphorical pats-on-the back to support each other,” she says. And finally, bed again, and time to rest after a day in a noisy environment (fans run constantly to disperse pockets of carbon dioxide so the astronauts can breathe, making it about as loud as a very noisy office). “We can have eight hours of sleep - but most people get stuck in the window looking at Earth,” Ms Stott says. All three astronauts talked about the psychological impact of seeing their home planet from 400km in orbit. “I felt very insignificant in that vastness of space,"" Ms Sharman says. ""Seeing Earth so clearly, the swirls of clouds and the oceans, made me think about the geopolitical boundaries that we construct and how actually we are completely interconnected."" Ms Stott says she loved living with six people from different countries “doing this work on behalf of all life on Earth, working together,  figuring out how to deal with problems”. “Why can't that be happening down on our planetary spaceship?” she asks. Eventually all astronauts must leave the ISS - but these three say they would return in a heartbeat. They don’t understand why people think the Nasa astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore are “stranded”. “We dreamed, worked and trained our entire lives hoping for an extended stay in space,"" says Mr Hadfield. ""The greatest gift you can give a professional astronaut is to let them stay longer."" And Ms Stott says that as she left the ISS she thought: “You're gonna have to pull my clawing hands off the hatch. I don't know if I'm going to get to come back.” Graphics by Katherine Gaynor and Camilla Costa","Astronauts on long stays must do two hours of exercise daily.

2134,2024-10-10 21:03:00,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2lk2mwwnxo,What's next for Elon Musk's SpaceX Starship rocket?,Technology & Science,Pollution,"Elon Musk wants his new rocket to revolutionise spaceflight. And that rocket, Starship, is now the largest and most powerful spacecraft ever built. It’s also designed to be fully and rapidly reusable. His private company SpaceX, which is behind the creation, is hoping to develop a spaceship that can be used more like a plane than a traditional rocket system, being able to land, refuel and take off again a few hours after landing. While there's no exact date set yet for the rocket’s next flight, it could be as soon as this weekend - and SpaceX is expecting big things. This will be Starship's fifth outing, and all eyes will be on the landing phases – specifically, the return of the vehicle’s bottom part, the Super Heavy booster. So far we’ve only seen what might be called a simulated landing at sea, or 'splashdown'. This will be the first time we hope to see the booster return to the launch pad. For a spacecraft to be reusable, it needs to be able to land safely. The SpaceX founder has said they will try to catch the booster in mid-air on its return to Earth using the giant mechanical arms, or ‘chopsticks’, of the launch tower – or as Musk calls it, “Mechazilla”. That's something that's never been done before, and eventually SpaceX want to catch the Ship - the top part of the vehicle - in the same way. But that won't happen on the upcoming test flight. None of Starship's missions so far have been crewed, and there's no plans to put people aboard for the next flight either. But Musk and his company do have grand designs that the rocket system will one day take humanity to Mars. A Mars trip isn't on the horizon just yet. But the behemoth rocket already has some impressive specs, and dwarfs all of its predecessors. Starship is a two-stage vehicle. The “Ship” is the uppermost part, and that sits atop a booster called Super Heavy. Thirty-three engines at the base of this booster produce around 74 meganewtons of thrust. To put that into perspective, it’s almost 700 times as powerful as the thrust generated by the common passenger plane, the Airbus A320neo. If you’ve flown with Aer Lingus, British Airways or Lufthansa, imagine the kick of taking off in one of those planes. Then multiply that by 700. The vehicle has grown about a metre since its second test flight in June of this year, with Starship now measuring just over 120m in total. This additional height comes from the Super Heavy booster itself being made 1m longer. It's also about twice as powerful as the Saturn V rocket which first took humanity to the Moon's surface. SpaceX says that power should be able to move a payload weighing at least 150 tonnes from the launchpad to low-Earth orbit. Both the Ship and the Super Heavy booster are fuelled with a mixture of icy-cold liquid methane and liquid oxygen fuel, known as methalox. Starship has had four test flights up to now. During the first flight, the rocket system exploded early, before the Booster was able to separate. It's worth noting that such hiccups are part of SpaceX's plan to speed up development by launching systems they know are not perfect and learning from the faults. And each test has seen real progress - first with a hitch-free separation, and eventually a successful return, where both the Ship and the Booster made a controlled descent and hovered above the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Mexico respectively until splashing down. Anyone watching nearby as the booster returns to Earth can expect a thunderous boom as it slows down from supersonic speeds. While SpaceX plan to catch the booster with the launch tower, we won’t get a similar return of the top part – the Ship – this time. When we do, it shouldn't look too different from the Super Heavy’s descent. But since there's no launch tower on Mars, or on the Moon for that matter, the Ship also needs to be able to land on its legs. To do that, it manoeuvres itself horizontally as it starts to descend, in what Musk has called a 'belly-flop' manoeuvre. This increases the drag on the vehicle, slowing it down. Once the Ship gets close enough to the surface, it’s then slow enough to fire its engines in a way that flips the vehicle into a vertical position. The Ship then uses its rockets to guide itself down safely and land on a hard pad upon its landing legs. All of this has been done by the Ship on its previous flight - apart from landing on a pad. So far it has only landed in the sea. One of the purposes of test flying is to highlight problem areas, and the quick turnaround between each test flight means that weak links have to be redesigned at lightning speed. If you get one thing wrong, the entire internal structure of the rocket could be melted by hot gases. There are a few things Starship could be used for soon. So far Musk has used his own rockets, like the Falcon 9 series, to launch his own commercial satellites, known as Starlink. Those satellites have a short lifespan of around five years, and the flock in orbit needs to be constantly replenished just to keep the same number of satellites in space. Nasa also wants to use Starship as part of its Artemis programme, which aims to establish a long-term human presence on the Moon. In the more distant future, Musk wants Starship to make long-haul trips to Mars and back – about a nine month trip each way. “You could conceivably have five or six people per cabin, if you really wanted to crowd people in. But I think mostly we would expect to see two or three people per cabin, and so nominally about 100 people per flight to Mars,” Musk said. The idea is to send the Ship part of the vehicle into low-Earth orbit, and “park” it there. It could then be refuelled in orbit by a SpaceX 'tanker' - essentially another Ship without the windows -  for its onward journey to Mars. It’s also conceivable that Starship could be used to launch space telescopes. The Hubble telescope is about the size of a bus, and the James Webb telescope is almost three times as big as that. To put up thousands of satellites quickly, or a bigger telescope, you need a big rocket. Finally, Starship has also been built to carry heavy loads needed to build space stations, and eventually, infrastructure for a human presence on the Moon. A rocket that kicks 700 times harder than a passenger jet is bound to have some impact on the environment. A draft environmental report by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) released in July shows that the new licence SpaceX is applying for would allow them 25 launches of Starship per year. The FAA say this would emit a total of 97,342 tonnes of CO2 equivalent - or 3,894 tonnes per launch. In comparison, a typical car in the US emits about 4.6 tonnes of CO2 per year, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. If we crunch the numbers, that means one launch of Starship emits as much greenhouse gas as 846 cars would emit over the course of a year. From a sheer numerical standpoint, that's fairly insignificant compared to say, the commercial aviation industry. But with Musk hoping to increase the number of launches to potentially hundreds per year in the future, those numbers could start adding up.","SpaceX's Starship rocket is the largest and most powerful ever built.

The findings come from a new analysis of data from Nasa’s Mars Insight Lander, which touched down on the planet back in 2018. The lander carried a seismometer, which recorded four years' of vibrations - Mars quakes - from deep inside the Red Planet. Analysing those quakes - and exactly how the planet moves - revealed ""seismic signals"" of liquid water. While there is water frozen at the Martian poles and evidence of vapour in the atmosphere, this is the first time liquid water has been found on the planet. The findings are published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . Insight's scientific mission ended in December 2022, after the lander sat quietly listening to ""the pulse of Mars"" for four years. In that time, the probe recorded more than 1,319 quakes. By measuring how fast seismic waves travel, scientists have worked out what material they are most likely to be moving through. ""These are actually the same techniques we use to prospect for water on Earth, or to look for oil and gas,"" explained Prof Michael Manga, from the University of California, Berkeley, who was involved in the research. The analysis revealed reservoirs of water at depths of about six to 12 miles (10 to 20km) in the Martian crust. “Understanding the Martian water cycle is critical for understanding the evolution of the climate, surface and interior,” said lead researcher Dr Vashan Wright, from UC San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Prof Manga added that water was ""the most important molecule in shaping the evolution of a planet"". This finding, he said, answers a big question of ""where did all the Martian water go?"". Studies of the surface of Mars - with its channels and ripples - show that, in ancient times, there were rivers and lakes on the planet. But for three billion years, it has been a desert. Some of that water was lost to space when Mars lost its atmosphere. But, said Prof Manga, here on Earth, ""much of our water is underground and there's no reason for that not to be the case on Mars too"". The Insight probe was only able to record directly from the crust beneath its feet, but the researchers expect that there will be similar reservoirs across the planet. If that is the case, they estimate that there is enough liquid water on Mars to form a layer across the surface that would be more than half a mile deep. However, they point out, the location of this Martian groundwater is not good news for billionaires with Mars colonisation plans who might want to tap into it. ""It's sequestered 10-20km deep in the crust,"" explained Prof Manga. ""Drilling a hole 10km deep on Mars - even for [Elon] Musk - would be difficult,"" he told BBC News. The discovery could also point to another target for the ongoing search for evidence of life on Mars. ""Without liquid water, you don't have life,"" said Prof Manga. ""So if there are habitable environments on Mars, those may be now deep underground.""","Scientists have discovered a reservoir of liquid water on Mars.

2928,2024-06-09 01:58:01,BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxwwjlrk1mlo,Who owns the Moon? A new space race means it could be up for grabs,Technology & Science,Politics & Law,"We’re in the midst of a Moon rush. A growing number of countries and companies  have the lunar surface in their sights in a race for resources and space dominance. So are we ready for this new era of lunar exploration? This week, images were beamed back to Earth of China’s flag unfurled on the Moon. It’s the country’s fourth landing there - and the first ever mission to return samples from the Moon’s far side. In the past 12 months, India and Japan have also set down spacecraft on the lunar surface. In February, US firm Intuitive Machines became the first private company to put a lander on the Moon, and there are plenty more set to follow. Meanwhile, Nasa wants to send humans back to the Moon, with its Artemis astronauts aiming for a 2026 landing. China says it will send humans to the Moon by 2030. And instead of fleeting visits, the plan is to build permanent bases. But in an age of renewed great-power politics, this new space race could lead to tensions on Earth being exported to the lunar surface. “Our relationship with the Moon is going to fundamentally change very soon,” warns Justin Holcomb, a geologist from the University of Kansas. The rapidity of space exploration is now “outpacing our laws”, he says. A UN agreement from 1967 says no nation can own the Moon. Instead, the fantastically named Outer Space Treaty says it belongs to everyone, and that any exploration has to be carried out for the benefit of all humankind and in the interests of all nations. While it sounds very peaceful and collaborative - and it is - the driving force behind the Outer Space Treaty wasn’t cooperation, but the politics of the Cold War. As tensions grew between the US and Soviet Union after World War Two, the fear was that space could become a military battleground, so the key part of the treaty was that no nuclear weapons could be sent into space. More than 100 nations signed up. But this new space age looks different to the one back then. One major change is that modern-day Moon missions are not just the projects of nations - companies are competing, too. In January, a US commercial mission called Peregrine announced it was taking human ashes, DNA samples and a sports drink, complete with branding, to the Moon. A fuel leak meant it never made it there, but it sparked debate about how delivering this eclectic inventory fitted in with the treaty’s principle that exploration should benefit all humanity. “We're starting to just send stuff up there just because we can. There's no sort of rhyme or reason anymore,” says Michelle Hanlon, a space lawyer and founder of For All Moonkind, an organisation that seeks to protect the Apollo landing sites. ""Our Moon is within reach and now we're starting to abuse it,” she says. But even if lunar private enterprise is on the increase, nation states still ultimately remain the key players in all this, Sa’id Mosteshar, director of the London Institute of Space Policy and Law, says any company needs to be authorised to go into space by a state, which will be limited by the international treaties. There’s still a great deal of prestige to be had by joining the elite club of Moon landers. After their successful missions, India and Japan could very much claim to be global space players. And a nation with a successful space industry can bring a big boost to the economy through jobs, innovation. But the Moon race offers an even bigger prize: its resources. While the lunar terrain looks rather barren, it contains minerals, including rare earths, metals like iron and titanium - and helium too, which is used in everything from superconductors to medical equipment. Estimates for the value of all this vary wildly, from billions to quadrillions. So it’s easy to see why some see the Moon as a place to make lots of money. However, it’s also important to note that this would be a very long-term investment -  and the tech needed to extract and return these lunar resources is a some way off. In 1979, an international treaty declared that no state or organisation could claim to own the resources there. But it wasn’t popular - only 17 countries are party to it, and this does not include any countries who’ve been to the Moon, including the US. In fact, the US passed a law in 2015 allowing its citizens and industries to extract, use and sell any space material. “This caused tremendous consternation amongst the international community,” Michelle Hanlon told me. “But slowly, others followed suit with similar national laws.” These included Luxembourg, the UAE, Japan and India. The resource that could be most in demand is a surprising one: water. “When the first Moon rocks brought back by the Apollo astronauts were analysed, they were thought to be completely dry,” explains Sara Russell, professor of planetary sciences at the Natural History Museum. “But then a kind of revolution happened about 10 years ago, and we found out that they’ve got little traces of water in them trapped in phosphate crystals.” And at the Moon’s poles, she says, there’s even more - reserves of water ice are frozen inside permanently shadowed craters. Future visitors could use the water for drinking, it could be used to generate oxygen and astronauts could even use it to make rocket fuel, by splitting it into hydrogen and oxygen, allowing them to travel from the Moon to Mars and beyond. The US is now attempting to establish a new set of guiding principles around lunar exploration - and lunar exploitation. The so-called Artemis Accords state that extracting and using resources on the Moon should be done in a way complies with the Treaty for Outer Space, although it says some new rules might be needed. More than 40 countries have so far signed up to these non-binding agreements, but China is notably absent from the list. And some argue that new rules for lunar exploration shouldn’t be led by an individual nation. “This really ought to be done through the United Nations because it affects all countries,” Sa’id Mosteshar tells me. But access to resources could also cause another clash. While there’s plenty of room on the Moon, areas close to ice-filled craters are the prime lunar real estate. So what happens if everyone wants the same spot for their future base? And once a country has set one up, what’s to stop another nation establishing their base a bit too close? “I think there's an interesting analogy to the Antarctic,” says Jill Stuart, a space policy and law researcher at the London School of Economics. “We'll probably see research bases being set up on the Moon like they are on the continent.” But specific decisions about a new lunar base, for example whether it covers a few square kilometres or a few hundred, may come down to whoever gets there first. “There will definitely be a first-mover advantage,” Jill Stuart says. “So if you can get there first and set up camp, then you can work out the size of your zone of exclusion. It doesn’t mean you own that land, but you can sit on that space.” Right now, the first settlers are most likely to be either the US or China, bringing a new layer of rivalry to an already tense relationship. And they are likely to set the standard - the rules established by whoever gets there first may end up being the rules that stick over time. If this all sounds a bit ad hoc, some of the space experts I’ve spoken to think we’re unlikely to see another major international space treaty. The dos and don’ts of lunar exploration are more likely to be figured out with memorandums of understanding or new codes of conduct. There’s a lot at stake. The Moon is our constant companion, as we watch it wax and wane through its various phases as it glows bright in the sky. But as this new space race gets under way, we need to start thinking about what sort of place we want it to be - and whether it risks becoming a setting where very Earthly rivalries are played out.

Crews on the ground in Kourou applauded as the rocket - developed at a cost of €4bn (£3.4bn) - soared into the sky. But after climbing smoothly to the desired altitude, and correctly releasing a number of small satellites, the upper-stage of the rocket experienced an anomaly right at the end of the flight. Computers onboard took the decision to prematurely shut down the auxiliary power unit (APU) that pressurises the propulsion system. This left Ariane's upper-stage unable to initiate the burn that was supposed to bring it out of orbit and also set up the final task of the mission – to jettison two re-entry capsules. Controllers were unable to remedy the situation, but the flight was nonetheless still declared a success. ""We're relieved; we're excited,"" said Josef Aschbacher, the director general of the European Space Agency. ""This is a historic moment. The inaugural launch of a new heavy-lift rocket doesn't happen every year; it happens only every 20 years or maybe 30 years. And today we have launched Ariane-6 successfully,"" he told reporters. Ariane-6 is intended to be a workhorse rocket that gives European governments and companies access to space independently from the rest of the world. It already has a backlog of launch contracts, but there are worries its design could limit future prospects. Like its predecessor, Ariane-5, the new model is expendable - a new rocket is needed for every mission, whereas the latest American vehicles are being built to be wholly or partially reusable. Even so, European space officials believe Ariane-6 can carve out a niche for itself. On the surface, the 6 looks very similar to the old 5, but under the skin it harnesses state-of-the-art manufacturing techniques (3D printing, friction stir welding, augmented reality design, etc) that should result in faster and cheaper production. Ariane-6 will operate in two configurations: The core stage is supplemented with a second, or upper, stage that will place the payloads in their precise orbits high above the Earth. This stage has the new capability to be stopped and restarted multiple times, which is useful when launching large batches of satellites into a constellation, or network. Re-ignition should also enable the stage to pull itself back down to Earth, so it won't become a piece of lingering space junk. The fact that the inaugural flight was unable to demonstrate this will be a disappointment to engineers, but shouldn't hold up the Ariane-6 programme. ""A lot of missions do not need to be restarted in microgravity. This is a flexibility we could use or not, and we will adapt the flight profile depending on what we find in the data,"" said Martin Sion, the chief executive of rocket manufacturer ArianeGroup. ""And to be 100% clear, we are prepared to make a second launch this year and six next year,"" added Stéphane Israël from Arianespace, the company that markets the new rocket. Inaugural flights are always occasions of high jeopardy. It's not uncommon for a new rocket design to have some sort of anomaly or outright failure. Ariane-5 famously blew itself apart 37 seconds after leaving the ground on its debut in 1996. The loss was put down to an error in control software. But a revised rocket then came back to dominate the commercial launch market for the world's biggest satellites. That dominance was only broken in the 2010s by US entrepreneur Elon Musk and his reusable Falcon-9 rockets. Falcon flight rates and prices undercut the competitiveness of Ariane-5. Europe is moving towards reusability, but the necessary technologies will not be in service until the 2030s. And in the meantime, Mr Musk is introducing even bigger rockets that promise to reduce launch costs still further. Ariane-6 enters a very challenging environment, therefore. ""We can all have our own opinions. What I can just reaffirm is that we have an order book that is full,"" said Lucia Linares, who heads space transportation strategy at Esa. ""I guess the word goes here to the customers: they have said Ariane-6 is an answer to their needs."" There are launch contracts to take the rocket through its first three years of operations. These include 18 launches for another US billionaire, Jeff Bezos, who wants to establish a constellation of internet satellites he calls Kuiper. European officials aim to have Ariane-6 flying roughly once a month. If this flight rate can be achieved, then the rocket should be able to establish itself, commented Pierre Lionnet from space consultancy ASD Eurospace. ""First, we need to ensure that there is sufficient demand from European customers - the European institutional ones. Then Ariane needs to win just a few commercial customers beyond Kuiper. This would give it a market,"" he told BBC News. ""But it's a matter of pricing. If Falcon-9 is systematically undercutting the price offer  of Ariane-6, there will be an issue."" Ariane-6 is a project of 13 member states of Esa, led by France (56%) and Germany (21%). The 13 partners have promised subsidy payments of up to €340m (£295m) a year to support the early phase of Ariane-6 exploitation. The UK was a leading player right at the beginning of Europe's launcher programme and remains an Esa member state, but its direct involvement in Ariane ended when the Ariane-4 model was retired, in 2003. A few UK companies continue to supply components on a commercial basis, and some spacecraft built in Britain will undoubtedly continue to fly on Ariane.","Ariane-6 blasted off from a launchpad in French Guiana at 16:00 local time (19:00 GMT) It was on a demonstration mission to put a clutch of satellites in orbit.

3184,2024-10-11 10:30:00,Grist,https://grist.org/regulation/california-plastic-bag-ban-loophole/,California inspired a wave of plastic bag bans — with an unfortunate loophole,Sustainability,Public Health & Environment,"Ten years ago, California became the first U.S. state to ban plastic bags . But over the next few years, the state’s landfills actually saw an increase in plastic waste . That’s because a loophole in the state’s bag ban allowed stores to continue offering plastic bags at checkout, so long as the bags cost a few cents, were labeled as reusable, and were made of thicker plastic. This thicker plastic, of course, meant that each new bag created more waste than its pre-ban counterpart when it found its way to a landfill. The idea behind the original law was to encourage people to eschew single-use bags and instead bring their own reusable ones to the store. What policymakers appear not to have realized is that it would take more than a 10-cent fee to change people’s behavior.   California finally closed its loophole last month . The legislature updated the original law to ban all non-paper bags from being distributed at store checkout stands. “Instead of being asked, ‘Do you want paper or plastic?’ at checkout, consumers will simply be asked if they want a paper bag, if they haven’t brought a reusable bag,” Democratic state Senator Catherine Blakespear said in a statement . “This straightforward approach is easy to follow and will help dramatically reduce plastic bag pollution.” Across the country, however, California’s pioneering efforts may have already spread not just copycat bag bans but also the loophole that undermines them. There are at least five other states — and potentially many more cities and counties — that have written the same exceptions into their regulations. Now that California’s error is becoming better known, efforts are underway to amend at least two other states’ existing bag bans. In states that are only now looking to introduce their first plastic bag bans, legislators are taking care not to replicate the mistakes of their predecessors. “You need a full ban on this stuff completely,” said Jack Egan, vice chair for the Connecticut chapter of the ocean conservation nonprofit Surfrider. “Otherwise, you’ve got a compromised, hamstrung, hard-to-enforce, easily worked-around ordinance.” As with California’s original law, each of the five states whose bag bans still allow thicker plastic bags — Connecticut , Maine , Oregon , Rhode Island , and Washington — defines a “reusable” plastic bag to include those that exceed a certain thickness: typically 4 mils, though Washington’s law started at 2.25 mils — the standard set by California — and is supposed to ratchet up to 4 in 2026. (One mil is equal to 0.0254 millimeters, comparable to the thickness of a dollar bill.) The origins of this thickness standard appear to be unknown. Some environmental groups told Grist that, when California lawmakers were dreaming up the state’s original bag ban, they were trying not to legislate away sturdy, reusable bags that happened to be made of plastic, like the ones available in Trader Joe’s checkout lines. But those bags are usually around 20 mils — 5 to 10 times thicker than those allowed by plastic bag ban laws. Other environmental advocates suggested it was pressure from the plastics industry that prevented a more straightforward ban on all bags made of plastic “film” — that is, polyethylene that is thin and stretchy — which would have included thicker versions. The American Recyclable Plastic Bag Alliance, a trade group, told the Hartford Courant in 2019 that “you can ban this product … but the alternative is worse, both economically and environmentally.” Melissa Gates, formerly the Northeast regional manager for Surfrider and now a director at Organizing for Impact, said Connecticut’s law was influenced by California’s, as well as by local ordinances from around the country. The version of the statewide ban that was backed by Surfrider included an exemption for thick plastic bags as a sort of “compromise” to win support from big food and retail industry associations. It worked. “It allowed for thicker plastic bags but only with a mandatory fee,” Gates said. The idea was to get rid of the most environmentally problematic bags — the really thin ones that are most likely to quickly end up trashed, clogged in recycling machines, or ensnared in tree branches — and then discourage people from buying the thicker ones by charging 10 cents a pop. A last-minute change by Democratic Governor Ned Lamont, however, removed the mandatory fee for thicker plastic bags, a move that Surfrider lamented at the time, given that it took away the disincentive for consumers to reuse bags. Even if the fee had stayed mandatory, however, it’s questionable whether it would have been high enough to get consumers to treat the thick bags any differently than they would treat a free, thinner bag. For many people, 8 cents is a negligible addition to their grocery bill, and not enough to prevent them from reusing thick bags just once or twice (if at all) — say, to line their trash cans or clean up after their dogs. Then, when they return to the grocery store, they have to buy new bags, incentivizing the bags’ continued production. “As an environmentalist and a social justice advocate, I would prefer that we immediately stop making unnecessary things out of plastic,” Gates said. Environmental advocates Grist spoke with said there’s no active campaign to amend the Connecticut bag ban, potentially because of fatigue over the decades-long back-and-forth that preceded the passage of the state’s 2019 law. Rhode Island seems to be in a similar situation: When the state finally implemented a bag ban this year , more than a decade after the idea was first introduced in the legislature , lawmakers were “so tired of talking about plastic bags,” Gates said. But things are looking up in Oregon, where State Senator Janeen Sollman, a Democrat, is planning to introduce a bill next year that would expand the statewide bag ban to cover disposable plastic bags of any thickness. Sollman told Grist she’s long known about the problems with California’s first bag ban , and that she tried to get around them with Oregon’s first bag ban, enacted in 2019. The law upped the required thickness of a reusable bag from 2.25 mils to 4 mils to encourage reuse — but it didn’t work. The plastics industry “just went around that, made a thicker bag, and then called it reusable,” Sollman said, even though that type of bag was ultimately “just ending up as another piece of garbage.” Sollman said her forthcoming bill will mirror the new California law, which redefines “carryout bag” to include any bag — other than a recycled paper bag — provided to customers at checkout. The bill is also expected to propose a phaseout of single-use plastic toiletries, like the kind offered in hotel rooms, along with some other measures to reduce plastic pollution. Meanwhile, other states are experimenting with different language to close the thick-bag loophole — or prevent it from opening in the first place. New York state’s plastic bag ban says a reusable bag must be made from “cloth or machine washable fabric” or “other non-film plastic washable material.” (Key word: “non-film.”) Colorado , Delaware , New Jersey , and Vermont say a bag is reusable only if it has “stitched handles.” In Massachusetts, which does not yet have a statewide bag ban, Surfrider helped draft a bill that used a combination of several other states’ strategies, requiring a reusable bag to have stitched handles while also clarifying that it “shall not include a bag made of plastic film of any thickness.” Senator Jamie Eldridge, a Democrat who’s been working on a statewide bag ban for the past decade, told Grist that that language was introduced after the plastics industry floated the idea of allowing thicker plastic bags. “At one point that was one of their pitches,” he said. “So we looked into it” — and rejected it, after seeing the consequences in other states and municipalities. “That’s why we strengthened the bill,” he added. This year’s version of the legislation passed the senate but isn’t expected to be voted on in the state’s house of representatives; Eldridge said he plans to reintroduce it during the next session. Erin Hass, director of the American Recyclable Plastic Bag Alliance, a trade group, said it didn’t lobby for the Massachusetts bill, but that it supports the use of thicker plastic bags. “The reality exists that consumers could take their film bags back to stores, which could then be routed into the existing circular film recycling infrastructure,” she told Grist. Previous investigations from ABC News and Bloomberg have suggested that most of the plastic bags deposited in store drop-off receptacles aren’t recycled. More often, they end up in landfills or incinerators. The two other bag ban states with thickness loopholes, Maine and Washington, don’t have pending bills to change their legislation. But that could be changing: Isabella DeFrancesco, Surfrider’s Northeast regional manager, said her organization’s Maine chapter is making it a “priority campaign” to get rid of that state’s thicker-bag allowance next year. And in Washington state, the Department of Commerce is supposed to submit a report to the legislature evaluating the efficacy of its existing bag law by the end of this year, giving lawmakers an opportunity to amend the thickness provision. Heather Trim, executive director of the nonprofit Zero Waste Washington, said the legislature may be tied up by other plastic-related bills during the next session, but her organization plans to prioritize an updated bag ban in 2026, using language similar to California’s new law. “I think California has nailed it,” she said. Gates, the former Surfrider manager, said she hopes a series of refreshed laws will reflect what has always been bag ban advocates’ intent: to eliminate single-use bags — whether paper or plastic — where they’re not needed, and to get people to bring their reusable bags to the grocery store. “The ultimate goal,” she said, is “shifting the consumer paradigm away from this wasteful tendency to view things as single-use, and prioritize convenience over almost everything else.” ","Ten years ago, California became the first U.S. state to ban plastic bags. Over the next few years, the state’s landfills actually saw an increase in plastic waste. A loophole allowed stores to continue offering plastic bags at checkout, so long as the bags cost a few cents, were labeled as reusable, and were made of thicker plastic. This thicker plastic, of course, meant that each new bag created more waste than its pre-ban counterpart when it found its way to a landfill.",http://res.cloudinary.com/drwsupfyj/image/upload/v1728699677/state-of-the-earth/news_photographs/californiainspiredawaveofplasticbagbanswithanunfortunateloophole.jpg
3056,2024-10-11 10:45:00,Grist,https://grist.org/technology/helene-and-milton-reveal-an-emerging-challenge-for-first-responders-ev-batteries-catching-fire/,Helene and Milton reveal an emerging challenge for first responders: EV batteries catching fire,Crisis & Disasters,Public Health & Environment,"When a hurricane like Helene or Milton ravages coastal communities, already-strained first responders face a novel, and growing, threat: the lithium-ion batteries that power electric vehicles, e-bikes, and countless gadgets. When exposed to the salty water of a storm surge, they are at risk of bursting into flames — and taking an entire house with them. “Anything that’s lithium-ion and exposed to salt water can have an issue,” said Bill Morelli, the fire chief in Seminole, Florida, and the bigger the battery, the greater the threat. That’s what makes EVs especially hazardous. “[The problem] has expanded as they continue to be more and more popular.”   It is not yet clear how many vehicles might have caught fire in the wake of Hurricane Milton , which slammed into Siesta Key on Wednesday, leaving at least 16 people dead and some 80,000 in shelters. But there have been 48 confirmed battery fires related to storm surge from Hurricane Helene , 11 of them associated with EVs. Morelli’s crews fought three of them. St. Petersburg Fire Rescue reported at least two, one from an electric bike and another from a Mercedes-Benz EQB300 that led to what a fire department representative called “major damage to the home.” CNN and other outlets reported on a fire in Sarasota sparked by a Tesla Model X. Overall, such fires are far from common. Idaho National Laboratory found that of the 3,000 to 5,000 electric vehicles damaged by Hurricane Ian in 2022, about three dozen caught fire . Public awareness of the risk has mounted since then, with officials up to and including Florida Governor Ron DeSantis urging residents to move their EVs to higher ground ahead of storms. But the chemistry and construction of lithium-ion batteries make them especially prone to fires that are difficult for first responders to combat. “They burn hot, they burn fast, and they’re hard to extinguish,” Morelli said. The battery in an EV is comprised of thousands of cells stacked and packed into a sealed enclosure. If salt water, which is particularly conductive, reaches the interior of a battery, it can cause a short circuit, which can generate excessive heat that jumps from cell to cell. “That’s called ‘thermal runaway,’” said Andrew Klock, senior manager of education and development at the National Fire Protection Association. As a battery heats up, it releases flammable gases that can ignite. Once the car starts burning, methods of putting out traditional vehicle fires — such as foam or thermal blankets to smother the flames — aren’t as effective. “Lithium-ion batteries generate their own oxygen and heat when they are on fire,” Klock said. “You can’t starve the fire.“ Instead, first responders must direct high volumes of water at the battery pack as directly as possible in order to reduce the heat. The International Association of Fire Chiefs recommends having 3,000 to 8,000 gallons on hand — which can be difficult during a disaster, when hydrants may not be working properly and trucks have a limited supply aboard. “They take tons and tons and tons and tons of water to extinguish,” said Morelli, who is working with other departments to acquire more thermal blankets. A ready supply of them could allow firefighters to smother the flames enough to move the car away from structures so it can burn itself out safely. Klock said “training is paramount” to effectively fighting these fires. But of the roughly 1.2 million firefighters in the country, only 350,000 or so have completed the association’s training, he said. “There’s a lot of work to do.” The danger doesn’t end when a storm passes, either. According to the Department of Transportation , “the time frame in which a damaged battery can ignite varies, from days to weeks,” which is one reason Tesla urges owners not to operate their vehicle until a dealer inspects it. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents 44 automakers and suppliers, declined to comment but cited a letter it sent to Republican Senator Rick Scott of Florida on the issue in 2022. It notes that “safety is a top priority for our members, which is why they have been engaged in long-standing efforts to address fire risks for both conventionally fueled vehicles and EVs.” In the meantime, a range of efforts are underway to try to prevent these fires from occurring. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has funded research into emerging hazards of at-home battery storage systems . Other researchers are looking at how to make batteries safer, including Yang Yang, an associate professor of materials science and engineering at the University of Central Florida. His team developed a battery that, instead of fighting salt water, utilizes it as the main electrolyte. “It can be soaked in the salty water and still works well,” said Yang, who started working on the project after living in Houston and Florida and seeing firsthand the problem floods present. While he said car companies have yet to contact him about his research, he’s optimistic that safer batteries could be on the market within the next few years. Until then, storms like Helene and Milton may be among the biggest drivers of public attention to both the problem and prevention methods. Yang, for one, finds that possibility bittersweet at best: “I don’t want people to have any issues with their electric vehicles.” This story has been updated.

3440,2024-10-10 10:30:00,Grist,https://grist.org/equity/black-residents-cancer-alley-last-legal-defense-toxic-pollution/,Black residents in Cancer Alley try what may be a last legal defense to curb toxic pollution,Politics & Law,Public Health & Environment,"On the banks of the lower Mississippi River in St. James Parish, Louisiana, on sprawling tracts of land that break up the vast wetlands, hulking petrochemical complexes light the sky day and night. They piled up over the past half century, built by fossil fuel giants like Nucor and Occidental. In that time, they replaced farmland with concrete and steel, and threaded the levees with pipelines that carry natural gas from as far away as West Texas. When the plants came, the lush landscape of this part of south Louisiana deteriorated. “The pecans are dry. They don’t yield like they used to,” said Gail Lebouf, a longtime resident of the region and a co-founder of the community group Inclusive Louisiana. “The fig trees, the blackberries — all that I came up making a living off of is not there anymore.”   Lebouf is a leading activist in “Cancer Alley,” the 85-mile stretch of land between Baton Rouge and New Orleans where strips of residential blocks are sandwiched between the region’s more than 150 petrochemical plants. She has spent the past several years fighting a new wave of industrial development headed to her parish — in particular, to its predominantly Black neighborhoods. The racialized permitting practices visible across Cancer Alley are particularly pronounced in St. James, where 20 of the parish’s 24 plants are located in the majority-Black 4th and 5th districts — an equivalent of 1 plant for every 250 people. In 2014, the parish council passed a zoning ordinance that marked much of those two districts for industrial use. That same year, the council barred two chemical companies, Petroplex and Wolverine, from constructing new industrial plants in the majority-white 3rd District. In 2022, the council conceded to white residents’ demands for a moratorium on solar farm development until they commissioned a study to determine if the project might lower their property values or put their homes at risk during a hurricane. Since 2018, the parish has supported the construction of a new $9.4 billion plastics manufacturing complex owned by the Taiwanese chemical giant Formosa in the 5th District. On a tract of land approximately the size of 80 football fields, the company plans to build 16 facilities that would release cancer-causing pollutants like ethylene oxide and vinyl chloride . The nearest neighborhood is approximately 1 mile down the road. A study by ProPublica found that Formosa’s emissions could more than triple the cancer risk in some St. James neighborhoods. In March 2023, the Mount Triumph Baptist Church and the local organizations Rise St. James and Inclusive Louisiana filed a lawsuit against the parish government, seeking an end to this alleged practice of discriminatory permitting. They hope to have a moratorium put in place on the licensing of heavy industry “and the correspondingly lethal levels of pollution” in the parish’s Black areas. Environmental advocates hailed it as a landmark case. But last November, a federal judge dismissed the complaint’s racial discrimination claims, pegging them to the 2014 zoning ordinance, and arguing that they are barred by the statute of limitations, which lasts for one year. “Although plaintiffs’ claims are procedurally deficient, this court cannot say that their claims lack a basis in fact or rely on a meritless legal theory,” U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier of the Eastern District of Louisiana wrote in his decision. On Monday, lawyers representing St. James residents presented their argument about the statute of limitations to the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. They claim that the parish’s long-standing practice of discriminatory land use decisions constitutes a “continuing violation” that cannot be dismissed simply because the zoning ordinance was passed outside the one-year statute of limitations period. “The parish’s decadeslong policy, practice, and custom of not only steering and luring lethal petrochemical plants to majority-Black districts, but doing so while implementing protections only for majority-white districts is discriminatory and unlawful,” said Sadaf Doost, an attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, in a press release. The defendant’s lawyers said that the plaintiffs should have taken note of the parish’s discriminatory zoning as soon as the ordinance was passed in 2014 and sued within the year. Judge Karen Hayes, who is hearing the appeal, seemed to challenge this reasoning , which, she said, makes it sound like “if you didn’t sue within a year then you can be discriminated against in a bunch of different ways until the rest of eternity.” Additionally, the plaintiffs’ lawyers, who are from the Center for Constitutional Rights and Tulane University’s Environmental Law Clinic, pushed back on the district judge’s finding last year that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring a claim under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act and the Louisiana Constitution’s protection of historic linguistic and cultural origins. The wide tracts of land along the Mississippi River that chemical companies bought up to build their sprawling industrial complexes were once plantations that used slave labor to grow sugarcane. Louisiana’s state archeologist, Charles McGimsey, believes that every former plantation in St. James contains unmarked cemeteries of former slaves. And so the plaintiffs are arguing that the parish’s land use decisions are discriminatory, because they allow chemical companies to build plants on land that is culturally significant. “Indeed, one of the lingering traumas of slavery is the inability of descendants to locate the gravesites of their ancestors,” the plaintiffs wrote in their original complaint. “But, in those cases where cemeteries can be identified, that location bears profound cultural, historical, and religious significance for descendants.” Last year, the district judge said that any harm to sites of historic, cultural, or religious significance is the fault of petrochemical companies — not the parish council. On Monday, the plaintiffs’ lawyers countered by arguing that the council’s zoning and permitting decisions have led to the destruction of the unmarked grave sites. The parish did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The success of the St. James case will hinge principally on whether the court accepts the plaintiffs’ argument about the statute of limitations, which would apply to four of their seven claims. If the judge also finds the racial discrimination complaints compelling, then the plaintiffs will have a stronger case. In the current judicial-political landscape, there are fewer legal mechanisms to argue cases of discrimination, particularly when it comes to environmental harms. Historically, environmental groups have had difficulty proving discrimination under the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection clause, since it focuses on discriminatory intent rather than prejudicial outcomes. “In order to be able to show that this discrimination is intentional you have to point to this pattern” — the parish council rejecting a solar farm in a white neighborhood but building a plastics plant in a Black one — said Pam Spees of the Center for Constitutional Rights on Monday . “They know what they’re doing.” As of August, Cancer Alley residents — and any other victims of environmental harms in Louisiana — now have one less legal tool to seek redress. After a long fight against the Environmental Protection Agency, federal judge James Cain ruled that the EPA cannot use a civil rights law that admits legal claims based on “disparate impacts” rather than discriminatory intent to curb toxic pollution in Louisiana. As difficult as such a fight may appear to be for residents like Gail Lebouf, St. James parish, despite itself, may be helping their case: In the time since the residents first filed their lawsuit in March, the parish has approved two more industrial projects — an expansion of Koch Methanol’s plant and an extension of the Acadian gas pipeline, which would attach to Koch — both zoned for St. James’s 5th District. ","St. James Parish, Louisiana, has more than 150 petrochemical plants. 20 of the parish’s 24 plants are located in the majority-Black 4th and 5th districts.

3312,2024-10-10 17:21:49,Grist,https://grist.org/extreme-weather/after-milton-florida-assesses-damage-from-back-to-back-climate-disasters/,"After Milton, Florida assesses damage from back-to-back climate disasters",Crisis & Disasters,Climate Change,"Hurricane Milton made landfall on Wednesday night, near Siesta Key, Florida, as a Category 3 storm, bringing ashore 120 mile-per-hour winds, heavy rain, and as much as a 10-foot storm surge into regions of the state still reeling from the impacts of Hurricane Helene just two weeks ago. By Thursday morning, Milton had crossed Florida and was headed out to sea, its hurricane force winds intact. “First responders have been working throughout the night,” Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said at a press conference on Thursday morning. “The storm was significant but, thankfully, this was not the worst-case scenario.”   While the state broadly avoided catastrophe, Milton still hit Floridians hard. In some coastal communities, floodwaters rose nearly up to second-floor levels, spurring dangerous middle-of-the-night rescues. Powerful winds ripped roofs off buildings — including Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg — and left more than 3 million homes and businesses without power. Farther inland, as much as 18 inches of rain fell in just a few hours, representing a 1 in 1000 year event . In the hours preceding landfall, the storm also kicked up roughly two dozen tornadoes across the state, one of which officials say hit a retirement community. At least six people died in the storm, and some 80,000 ended up in shelters. “We have flooding in places and to levels that I’ve never seen, and I’ve lived in this community for my entire life,” Bill McDaniel, the city manager of Plant City told The Guardian , calling it “absolutely staggering.” Floridians were still cleaning up debris and damage from Hurricane Helene when Milton formed in the Gulf of Mexico. Fueled by near record-warm waters from a waning El Niño and climate change, the storm jumped from a Category 1 to a Category 5 with 180 mph winds in just 24 hours — one of the most rapid intensifications in history . Forecasts originally had the storm’s northern right side, also known as the “dirty side” of a hurricane, hitting Tampa, which would have funneled water straight up the bay into one of the lowest-lying cities in the United States. The hurricane weakened slightly, however, and came ashore a bit south, which not only avoided the most dire flooding possibilities, but actually sucked water out of the bay . “Do not walk out into receding water in Tampa Bay,” the Florida Division of Emergency Management, or FDEM, warned on X . “The water WILL return through storm surge and poses a life-threatening risk.” The region’s back-to-back hurricanes represent the compounding disasters that scientific models have predicted will become more frequent with climate change. They also come at a time when the Federal Emergency Management Agency is running out of money and staff . As Milton approached, more than 40 congressional Democrats wrote to Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, imploring him to reconvene the chamber to vote on additional funding for FEMA. Johnson has previously said he won’t take up the matter until after the November 5 elections — a month from now. At Thursday morning’s press conference, officials continued to urge caution across the state. Rivers could still flood, roads remained impassable, and debris was abundant. They also warned residents to be careful as they began to clean up, as downed lines and other hazards could be extremely dangerous. “We do not need Florida Man and Florida Woman out there cutting random lines as they go,” said Kevin Guthrie, the executive director of FDEM. “Let our crews get out there and get everything back up and running.” ","Hurricane Milton made landfall on Wednesday night, near Siesta Key, Florida, as a Category 3 storm. Milton brought 120 mile-per-hour winds, heavy rain, and as much as a 10-foot storm surge into regions of the state still reeling from Hurricane Helene just two weeks ago. In some coastal communities, floodwaters rose nearly up to second-floor levels, spurring dangerous middle-of-the-night rescues. At least six people died in the storm, and some 80,000 ended up in shelters.",http://res.cloudinary.com/drwsupfyj/image/upload/v1728699682/state-of-the-earth/news_photographs/aftermiltonfloridaassessesdamagefrombacktobackclimatedisasters.jpg

Parts of Florida’s Gulf Coast are bracing for a Category 3 hurricane just two weeks after Hurricane Helene made landfall, devastating much of the state’s Panhandle region and southern Appalachia. Nearly a dozen counties in Florida have received evacuation orders to prepare for Hurricane Milton, which stunned meteorologists with its extreme rapid intensification and is expected to make landfall Wednesday night.   The one-two punch of back-to-back hurricanes is straining federal disaster relief resources. As FEMA contends with Helene recovery as well as wildfires blazing across the West , only 8 percent of the agency’s incident management staff is available to respond to new disasters, according to its daily operations briefing for Wednesday. FEMA faced funding problems well before Helene came along: In a report on the state of the agency’s disaster relief fund from the end of August, FEMA projected it would hit a deficit the following month. A few weeks later, in September, Congress allocated $20 billion to the emergency agency as part of a stopgap spending bill meant to avoid a government shutdown. But in the week after Helene made landfall, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, whose Cabinet department houses FEMA, said the agency would not have enough money to get through the rest of hurricane season, which lasts through the end of November. President Joe Biden has since urged lawmakers to send more money FEMA’s way — so the agency can avoid making the “unnecessary trade-off” of diverting resources away from long-term recovery efforts in order to address any immediate emergencies. Additional funding seems unlikely to arrive in time to affect recovery efforts for Hurricane Milton. Speaking to Fox News, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said he will not bring the lower chamber of Congress back from its October break to consider sending more money to FEMA, and that he won’t consider the matter until after the November 5 election. FEMA uses its disaster relief fund to do things like pay for disaster support and local debris removal , repair damaged public infrastructure, and offer financial aid to qualifying victims. The fund spent an average of $12 billion dollars annually between 1992 and 2021, with 44 percent of that money going to hurricane relief. But in the wake of Helene, FEMA has faced a barrage of bogus rumors about disaster relief dollars being misused and redirected toward housing migrants. The agency has plainly denied the claim on its website: “This is false. No money is being diverted from disaster response needs.” FEMA does have a small grant program, representing less than 3 percent of its annual budget , that provides humanitarian support for noncitizen immigrants being released from detention facilities — but this program is entirely separate from its disaster relief fund. Still, rumors about misspent disaster funding created by right-wing pot-stirrers like radio host Alex Jones and Representative Marjorie Taylor-Greene of Georgia, who claim that FEMA is botching its response to Helene, have added fuel to the fire. Although the rumors of redirected funds are baseless, they have proved to be sticky, with several Republican lawmakers spreading the misinformation. For example, when asked why she voted against the congressional stopgap measure that sent $20 billion to FEMA, Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn, who represents Tennessee, called the bill “reckless” and said she would not fund “ flying illegals into our country .” In his Fox News interview, Speaker Mike Johnson conceded that, yes, FEMA’s disaster relief and migrant aid dollars come from two different pools of funding — and then continued to conflate the two efforts . As Republicans politicize disaster relief operations, Mayorkas backtracked on FEMA’s funding needs. On Wednesday, the homeland security secretary stated that FEMA “quite clearly” has everything it needs to effectively respond to Hurricane Milton. Meanwhile, FEMA itself has largely downplayed any pressures on its staff. Administrator Deanne Criswell told MSNBC that the agency is well positioned to address the needs of areas hit by Hurricane Milton — after all, disaster relief personnel are already on the ground in Florida as part of its Helene response. As extreme weather events are made worse by climate change and impact more of the country, disaster relief needs will continue to grow. On Wednesday, dozens of Democratic members of Congress urged Johnson to reconvene the House to pass additional disaster relief funding. And some Republican lawmakers — even those who originally voted against the congressional bill that sent $20 billion to the emergency management agency — are now publicly calling for more money for FEMA. Last week, Representative Anna Paulina Luna introduced a bipartisan bill to allocate $15 billion to FEMA and the U.S. Department of Housing of Urban Development to aid Helene recovery efforts. “ We need FEMA DOLLARS FREE’D UP ,” wrote Luna in a tweet directed at the vice president, and presidential nominee, Kamala Harris. Luna’s district includes most of Pinellas County, Florida, which Milton is expected to hit. Luna previously voted against the measure to fund FEMA through the end of the calendar year.

3824,2024-10-08 18:44:26,Grist,https://grist.org/extreme-weather/hurricane-milton-helene-debris-florida/,"‘I can’t think straight’: Still buried beneath Helene’s debris, Floridians brace for Milton",Crisis & Disasters,Climate Change,"Less than two weeks ago, Val Stunja was frantically stacking furniture and belongings on her kitchen countertop. Hurricane Helene was bearing down on the west coast of Florida, and she was preparing her first-floor condominium in St. Petersburg, a Tampa Bay city that sits on a barrier island just a few hundred feet from the Gulf of Mexico. Stunja, who works as an airline dispatcher, rode out the storm with a friend on the second floor and watched in horror as the storm surge inundated the streets around her. A wall of water several feet deep destroyed almost everything she owns; outside, it pushed cars and boats around like toys. Stunja thought she could save her own vehicle by parking it on higher ground a few miles inland, but the storm surge flooded it as well.   Crews had only just begun the arduous task of clearing shattered homes, ruined cars, and unfathomable amounts of debris from the neighborhoods around Stunja’s condo when she started to hear about another major storm: Milton , a tropical storm that formed in the Gulf of Mexico over the weekend and grew with stunning ferocity into a Category 5 hurricane over the course of less than a day on Monday. Stunja was already headed toward a friend’s home in Sarasota, an hour south of Tampa, when she learned that the storm was headed right for her. She turned around and tried to fly to her hometown in Texas. When that failed, she got into a car loaned by her insurance company on Monday afternoon and made for her son’s house in Jacksonville, spending hours in bumper-to-bumper traffic headed north and east. “I can’t think straight,” she said. “I’m very confused. I haven’t even filed a claim yet on my house.” Stunja is among hundreds of thousands of Floridians staring down a direct hit from a second major hurricane — even before they’ve come anywhere close to reckoning with the damage from Hurricane Helene . The quick turnaround has given Florida residents little time to find, let alone regain, their footing. The unfinished cleanup of the mess Helene created could compound the devastation to come from Hurricane Milton, and the one-two punch could have a devastating impact on the state’s ability to recover. After Milton exploded in intensity, becoming a worst-case Category 5 hurricane within 24 hours, its wind speed surged to nearly 180 mph . Meteorologists attribute the rapid intensification to record-hot sea surface temperatures made 400 to 800 times more likely due to climate change . Forecasters say Hurricane Milton could lash the Florida Panhandle with storm surges reaching 12 feet high and bring as much as 15 inches of rain, potentially creating flash floods. Republican Governor Ron DeSantis had declared a state of emergency for more than 50 counties as of Monday, and several were under evacuation orders — including many told just 14 days ago to evacuate ahead of Helene . “A lot of the damage that occurred with Helene is going to get worse,” said Carlos Martin, director of the Remodeling Futures Program at the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. Wreckage from Helene could be whipped into the air by Hurricane Milton. In the Tampa Bay area, more than 300 vehicles carted broken furniture and other trash to a landfill on Sunday , while lifeguards removed chairs and other items from beaches. Sarasota County, just south of Tampa, said it was focusing “ all efforts on removing Hurricane Helene debris ” in the most vulnerable places, and the county lifted landfill fees for people living in unincorporated areas. Progress has been exceedingly slow, however; the mayor of Clearwater, a city just north of St. Petersburg, said on Sunday that only 5 percent of the debris on Clearwater Beach had been cleared. Some residents don’t think the city and the Federal Emergency Management Agency are doing enough to clear away the wreckage ahead of the impending storm. “This is going to all be weapons,” Clearwater resident Monika Spaldo said, referring to the waterlogged furniture and trash surrounding her. “The debris from all of this is going to hit windows, roofs, cars, people. … It’s going to fly and destroy everything.” Spaldo is a property manager at Coconut Grove, a beachside condominium complex that was damaged by storm surge from Hurricane Helene. In the days following the storm, she felt so sick from exposure to dirty floodwaters and refuse that she almost went to the hospital. With Hurricane Milton rapidly approaching, she is terrified by all the debris lining the streets — and what the storm to come will mean for the town’s future. “I don’t know how we’re ever going to recover,” she said. “Everything on the island is going to be destroyed.” Meanwhile, experts are concerned that the two disasters striking in quick succession will complicate the essential process of filing insurance claims in order to make victims whole for the financial damage they’ve suffered. Those who experienced losses during Helene are supposed to document them before evacuating ahead of Milton, so that claims adjusters can differentiate the damage caused by the two events. Lisa Miller, a former deputy insurance commissioner for Florida, called the situation “unparalleled.” “All bets are off,” she added. For many victims, filing insurance claims so quickly could well be impossible, given the rapid sequence of events and the urgency of current evacuation orders. In Sarasota County on Monday, residents were urged to leave immediately. “If you wait, you will get stuck in traffic,” a government website warned . Some people, like Stunja, may head to relatives’ homes in safer areas. But because Helene reached up to 500 miles inland in some parts of Florida, they may have to travel much farther than that to find suitable accommodations. Others may need to take shelter in schools or athletic facilities, which are listed in a county-by-county directory compiled by the Florida Division of Emergency Management. The Federal Emergency Management Agency often steps in to run shelters during major emergencies, but its capacity may be limited by a major staffing shortage as it continues to deal with the aftermath of Hurricane Helene — along with fires, flooding, landslides, and tornadoes in several other states. In the longer term, the storms may exacerbate Florida’s insurance crisis . “People’s premiums are going to go through the roof,” said Martin of the Remodeling Futures Program at the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. The state is already the most expensive in the country for home insurance, according to a 2024 report by Insurify, a digital insurance agent. Helene and Milton could increase the cost of housing in other ways as well. Buildings that were damaged during Helene could become unrecoverable after Milton, making it harder for people to return. Sara McTarnaghan, a principal research associate at the nonprofit policy research organization the Urban Institute, said Florida hasn’t even yet recovered from vulnerabilities in its housing stock that were created by storms that struck years ago, including Idalia , Ian , and Michael . “Many parts of Florida have experienced multiple events over the past five to 10 years, which is the timeline for recovery and making repairs to existing housing,” she said. “Depending on the trajectory of Hurricane Milton it could be hitting a vulnerable housing stock, and we could be seeing more loss of units, more costly repairs.” As Stunja prepares to ride out Hurricane Milton in Jacksonville, she still doesn’t know what she’s going to do after the storm passes. She’s just begun to work through her flood insurance claim with FEMA, but the surge from Milton could flood both floors of her condo building. If that happens, she doesn’t think she’ll be able to stay. “If the second floor gets water on this one, the building’s probably a tear-down,” she said. “If that happens, I’ll go off-island. I love Florida, but I don’t need to be on the beach.” Jake Bittle and Ayurella Horn-Muller contributed reporting to this story. ","Two weeks ago, Val Stunja was preparing her first-floor condominium in St. Petersburg, Florida. She watched in horror as the storm surge inundated the streets around her.

3696,2024-10-09 10:30:00,Grist,https://grist.org/climate/azolla-climate-friendly-food-cyanobacteria/,"Ducks love to eat this climate-friendly food. Now you might, too.",Public Health & Environment,Sustainability,"Like a priceless painting, the beautiful blue and green swirl in a lake or pond presents a look-don’t-touch kind of situation. It’s the work of proliferating cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, which produces toxins that are poisonous to humans and other animals, especially when blooms corrupt freshwater supplies. These toxins, which the microbes evolved to deter herbivores, are linked to ALS and Parkinson’s disease, plus muscle paralysis and liver and kidney failure. One of the toxins, anatoxin-a, is known as Very Fast Death Factor , in case you were doubting that toxicity. It seemed a shame, then, that a highly nutritious fern called Azolla — that green mat ducks eat on ponds — long ago made a pact with a species of cyanobacteria, an “endocyanobiont.” Living inside the fern, the microbes get shelter, and provide the plant with essential nitrogen in return. Lately, scientists have been campaigning to turn the fast-growing Azolla into a food of the future. Others envision it becoming both a sustainable biofuel and a fertilizer that captures carbon. But these ideas aren’t likely to get very far if the cyanobacteria living within end up being highly toxic.   A new paper suggests that Azolla may find its way to plates one day: An international team of researchers discovered that endocyanobiont is no typical cyanobacteria. “The cyanobacteria that lives in Azolla doesn’t produce any of these toxins, and it doesn’t even have the genes required to create those toxins,” said Daniel Winstead, a Penn State research technologist and coauthor of the paper. “So that takes one of those barriers away towards its use as food or even livestock feed.” This is not to say that anyone should find a local pond, skim off the Azolla, and eat it by the handful. Other research groups need to confirm that Azolla is fully nontoxic and safe for consumption before an industry can develop and produce the plant for food. Winstead’s previous research found that while some species of Azolla are high in harmful polyphenols, a species native to the southeastern United States called Carolina Azolla has much lower levels that are further lowered to safe amounts by cooking. Azolla is also high in protein and nutrients like potassium, zinc, iron, and calcium. Azolla and the cyanobacteria it harbors have co-evolved a mutually beneficial relationship. Floating out in the open, other cyanobacteria species synthesize toxins to ward off hungry fish. “For the cyanobacteria to live within the Azolla, it can’t produce those toxins or it’d also kill the plant,” Winstead said. “So at some point, it didn’t have those genes anymore, and that’s unique among cyanobacteria.” In return for providing the microbes housing, the Azolla gets an extremely valuable resource: nitrogen. Plants need that element to thrive, but not many species can pull it from the atmosphere themselves. So-called “nitrogen-fixers,” such as beans and clovers, rely on bacteria in their roots to process nitrogen into something the plant can use to grow. The endocyanobiont does the same for Azolla, helping supercharge the growth that allows the plant to double its biomass as quickly as every two days. Winstead said that some smallholder farmers already use Azolla as fertilizer , and now that the cyanobacteria are confirmed to be nontoxic, perhaps the technique can spread. With that natural source of nitrogen, farmers would be less reliant on synthetic fertilizers, whose production and use spews greenhouse gases and pollutes rivers and lakes. Azolla could also be used as livestock feed, as some farmers are already doing if they can’t afford traditional feed for cattle and poultry. Back in the 1980s and ‘90s, farmers in China managed to exploit Azolla for both purposes. They grew Azolla in their flooded rice paddies, added fish that fed on the plants, then ate the fish. But it was a difficult process. It was labor-intensive to grow, since farmers needed to separate the fishes before applying herbicides or pesticides. When the fields drained, crews worked the Azolla into the soils as a fertilizer, but that was labor-intensive, too. While Azolla can fix its own nitrogen thanks to its cyanobacteria, it needed applications of phosphorus to really get growing in rice paddies. “There is no free lunch,” said Jagdish Ladha, a soil scientist and agronomist at the University of California, Davis, who wasn’t involved in the new paper. Those farmers in China switched to using cheap synthetic fertilizers instead. But the idea behind industrializing the production of Azolla would be to produce the plant at a larger scale, then conveniently package it as fertilizer or livestock feed. Beyond its potential in farming, Azolla could also become a biofuel, according to Winstead, much as corn has been used to make biodiesel. That fuel would be close to carbon-neutral: As the plant grows, it sequesters carbon; burning the biofuel would then release that carbon back into the atmosphere. By incorporating Azolla into soils as fertilizer, farmers would put still more carbon into the ground. Humans might also shape Azolla like they’ve modified other crops like wheat and corn, selectively breeding the most desired traits, such as bigger grains. “There’s a lot of potential for Azolla to go through that process,” Winstead said, “whether it’s creating a variation of Azolla that tastes the best, or it’s a variation of Azolla that has the most vitamins or the most protein, or maybe the best nitrogen-fixing ability.” ","A fern called Azolla makes a pact with a species of cyanobacteria, an “endocyanobiont” Living inside the fern, the microbes get shelter, and provide the plant with essential nitrogen in return. Scientists have been campaigning to turn the fast-growing Azolla into a food of the future.

27,2024-10-08 15:00:00,Grist,https://grist.org/state-of-emergency/how-helene-changes-the-election/,How Helene changes the election,Climate Change,Public Health & Environment,"Hello, and welcome back to State of Emergency . My name is Zoya Teirstein. We’ve heard it time and again: Despite what the science says, climate change does not rank high among Americans’ priorities in the ballot box. When we launched this series in August, however, we made the case that climate disasters can influence voting and elections — not just locally, but nationally. We’ve just seen proof of that in Hurricane Helene. Two weeks ago, the Category 4 storm carved a deadly path through the U.S. Southeast — the first time in American history that a major disaster has hit two swing states, Georgia and North Carolina, just weeks ahead of a presidential election. On social media and on trips to the disaster zone, former President Donald Trump has made one bogus claim after another about the federal response to the storm, falsely alleging that President Joe Biden has been ignoring federal aid requests from Georgia’s Republican Governor, Brian Kemp, and that the Biden administration — and Vice President Kamala Harris, specifically — spent FEMA money on housing for illegal immigrants. Trump proxies like Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right representative from Georgia, and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, aided by an online army of bots, helped fuel a veritable deluge of disinformation about Helene and its origins, include a barrage of claims that FEMA is confiscating community-donated supplies. “Yes they can control the weather,” Greene posted on X last week, legitimizing a viral conspiracy that the government aimed the hurricane at Republican counties in order to swing the presidential election. “We’ve moved into a space where conspiratorial thinking has become mainstream,” said Rachel Goldwasser, who tracks far-right activity and disinformation at the nonprofit Southern Poverty Law Center. “Every tinfoil hat out there that says the government controls the weather now feels validated because Marjorie Taylor Greene said so, too.” The online conspiracies have real-world consequences: False reports about FEMA and federal aid efforts are drowning out real information people in western North Carolina and other ravaged states need in order to begin the recovery process, and false claims about government malfeasance are galvanizing far-right militia activity in the region, Goldwasser said. There have been multiple reports of Proud Boys, the neo-fascist militant organization, on the ground in North Carolina and Tennessee. Meanwhile, in western North Carolina, election officials are racing to figure out how to make sure residents can still cast their ballots during early voting and on November 5. Several polling locations are shut down, and the U.S. Postal Service can’t deliver mail-in ballots to multiple ZIP codes because of washed-out roads and damaged vehicles. “This storm is like nothing we’ve seen in our lifetimes in western North Carolina,” Karen Brinson Bell, one of the state’s top election officials, said last week. On Monday, the North Carolina Board of Elections voted unanimously to loosen voting rules for counties most affected by the storm. Thirteen counties in the western half of the state can develop new early-voting processes, establish more voting sites, and appoint new poll workers if existing ones are unable to serve, among other authorizations. “Early voting may look different in some of the 13 hardest-hit counties, but it will go on,” Brinson Bell told reporters. Read the full story on how Helene could impact voting in North Carolina. Hurricane Milton exploded to Category 5 intensity yesterday as it barreled eastward across the Gulf of Mexico toward Florida. The storm’s precise track is still unclear, but the majority of models predict it will make landfall tomorrow in or near Tampa Bay, one of the most vulnerable cities in the United States to hurricane storm surge. The city hasn’t seen a direct hit from a hurricane in a century, but if Milton lands in the wrong spot, the bay would act as a kind of funnel for storm surge, pushing a huge wall of water into the heart of one of the country’s largest metropolitan areas. To make matters worse, coastal communities in western Florida are still emerging from post-Helene chaos. Thousands of tons of debris are strewn along roadways, flooded residents are mucking out their houses, and FEMA is just starting to distribute displacement assistance to the victims of last month’s storm. Governor Ron DeSantis last week sent many of the state’s rescue and repair crews up to North Carolina to aid in the disaster response there, but he recalled those crews over the weekend and is now pushing to clean up as much debris as possible before Milton makes landfall. My colleague Matt Simon has more on how Milton gained strength so fast — read the full story here . — Jake Bittle Presidential candidates flex their disaster chops: Donald Trump and Kamala Harris both visited areas affected by Hurricane Helene last week, with Trump touring damaged areas in Valdosta, Georgia, and Harris surveying a destroyed town in North Carolina. Each candidate accused the other of not doing enough to help storm victims. Read more FEMA is out of money: President Joe Biden over the weekend urged Congress to return to Washington and pass a bill replenishing FEMA’s drained disaster relief fund. The agency has said it lacks the resources to respond to a major disaster like Hurricane Milton, but Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said on Sunday that he wouldn’t commit to calling lawmakers back. Read more Helene and manufactured housing: When Hurricane Helene made landfall on Florida’s Big Bend, it struck a region where a large portion of the housing stock consists of mobile and manufactured homes, which are extremely vulnerable to wind and flood damage. These homes, which aren’t subject to local building codes, are a last resort for residents who can’t find affordable housing — and a loophole for those who can’t afford to build to hurricane standards. Read more Who’s going to pay for Helene?: Preliminary damage estimates for Hurricane Helene suggest the storm could cost more than $200 billion, but almost none of that loss will be covered by insurance. That’s because traditional homeowner’s insurance doesn’t cover flood damage, and most people in North Carolina and other inland states don’t carry additional flood insurance. Read more A word from Al Gore: My colleague Kate Yoder sat down with former vice president Al Gore at Climate Week to get his thoughts on where we stand in the climate fight. The Inconvenient Truth creator, who lost the 2000 election by a hair, said even he has been surprised by how difficult it has been to make climate progress, a fact he attributed to the strength of the oil and gas lobby. Read more DeSantis is dodging Harris: As Category 5 Hurricane Milton draws near Tampa, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, is dodging Vice President Kamala Harris’s calls about storm recovery in his state, NBC News reports.

155,2024-10-08 10:45:00,Grist,https://grist.org/extreme-weather/hurricane-helene-electricity-grid-north-carolina/,Hurricane Helene brought devastation — and an opportunity — to Appalachia’s power grids,Climate Change,Public Health & Environment,"By the time that Hurricane Helene made its way hundreds of miles inland on September 27, it had been downgraded to a tropical storm. But Helene remained unusually expansive and strong, fueled by the warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico. The storm brought high winds and catastrophic flooding, knocking out power for more than 2 million Duke Energy customers in the Carolinas, and tearing through a region of the country that wasn’t widely seen as vulnerable to hurricane damage: the Mountain South. Asheville, North Carolina, the city hardest hit, had even appeared on lists of “climate havens” considered comparatively safe from the natural disasters whose impacts are intensified by global warming. Over the course of the following week, more than 50,000 utility workers , with crews from 41 U.S. states and Canada, set about the heroic work to restore power. In some areas, they even transported power poles by helicopter where roads remained impassable. By Saturday, service had been restored to more than 90 percent of the customers who lost power. But some of the remaining outages may prove harder to repair, because they require the complete replacement of technically complex power infrastructure equipment. These repairs “will take potentially many weeks,” said Jeff Brooks, a Duke Energy spokesperson.   The unprecedented devastation has brought renewed attention to the problem of ensuring the resilience of America’s power grids in the face of climate change, and to the massive transformation that decarbonization , electrification, and a projected growth in electricity demand bring. Global shortages of crucial electrical equipment like transformers and circuit breakers don’t make that question any easier to figure out. Electrical equipment and water don’t mix, so heavy flooding presents a serious threat to power grids that aren’t prepared for it. “There has been a dramatic miscalculation of risk factors here,” said Tyler Norris, a Duke University doctoral fellow and former special advisor at the Department of Energy. “So this event is going to have to prompt a wide range of new analysis on the vulnerability of various parts of the power system.” Among the challenges that western North Carolina will face in rebuilding its grid are its geographic differences from the regions where various solutions have been tested. Norris described the region as “a mountainous area that still has a relatively decent population density.” In low-lying coastal areas that are more accustomed to hurricanes, for instance, some utility companies have begun moving power lines underground to avoid the problems that hurricane-force winds pose. But in Duke Energy’s service area, “you have this really far-flung set of distribution lines going up into the hills and serving different communities,” Norris continued. Last week, an early report from North Carolina congressman Chuck Edwards claiming that 360 substations in North Carolina were “out” because of flooding caused a minor panic among grid experts , who worried that there simply weren’t enough transformers in reserve in the U.S. to rebuild that many substations. Transformers are the pieces of electrical equipment required to shift an electric current from one voltage to another. They are needed at either end of a transmission line — the massive power lines that transmit electricity at a high voltage between power plants and the lower-voltage distribution lines that power homes and businesses. They are housed in substations, the junctions between the transmission and distribution systems. It turns out that the crisis wasn’t so dire. Of the 360 substations that were reported down, most “were out because of damage to the transmission system that supplies them with power, not necessarily damage to all those substations,” said Brooks, the Duke Energy spokesperson. But even a handful of destroyed substations is no small matter. At least two sites, the utility has trucked in temporary “mobile substations” that will power nearby communities until the equipment can be repaired. In normal times, said John Wilson, a vice president at the consulting firm Grid Strategies, it takes over a year to build a new substation from scratch, including drawing up a site-specific design and procuring the equipment. Rebuilding can be a significantly shorter process when the designs are already complete, and utilities keep some amount of equipment in reserve. But the depletion of those reserves would only add to the potential supply chain bottleneck for future crises. Global demand for transformers is growing, in part because the transition to renewable energy will require many more sites of power generation than the old fossil fuel-powered system — and each new power plant requires its own equipment. With few manufacturers of transformers operating in the U.S., utilities must wait an average of 150 weeks for an order to arrive. While it’s unclear whether the storm recovery will be directly impeded by the transformer shortage, it may breathe life into solutions that have been recently proposed. In September, the president’s National Infrastructure Advisory Council recommended that the federal government create a strategic reserve of transformers to bypass the industry’s long lead times. And in a report published in August, Grid Strategies recommended that utilities band together in a collective procurement organization — ideally with federal loan backing — to make large orders and share the costs. “That would help deal with the construction backlog; right now, manufacturers are hesitant to build new factories to build this equipment in the U.S. or North America because they aren’t confident that the market will be there,” said Wilson. The reconstruction of the power grid in the areas of Appalachia where it was wrecked by Helene will ultimately offer a chance for the utility industry to rethink how the electricity system should be structured. “​​In areas where there could be more extreme weather events like this, it’s going to be more and more difficult to maintain far-flung distribution systems,” Norris said. “And the cost of service is going to rise, and you either have to muddle through that or think about other measures, like undergrounding lines, or trying to bring load into higher degrees of concentration so it isn’t so far-flung, or, obviously, to think more about distributed energy systems and backup power.” There are ways to build grid resilience that could be implemented on a more local level — although they’re costly. One is the concept of microgrids — local electric grids that are disconnected from the wider power system. Norris said this concept could be extended further by allowing individual homes and businesses to power themselves with rooftop solar when the grid is down. Most solar arrays aren’t configured to produce power when there isn’t a wider grid to feed them into, in order to protect the line workers repairing power lines from a live current. But this can be prevented by a technique called solar islanding, which effectively disconnects the solar array from the grid. Last week, Duke Energy used one such microgrid , in the flooded resort town of Hot Springs, North Carolina, to keep the lights on downtown for days using only batteries and solar power . For towns like Hot Springs, microgrids could be much more than temporary patches. ","Hurricane Helene knocked out power for more than 2 million Duke Energy customers in the Carolinas. The storm brought renewed attention to the problem of ensuring the resilience of America’s power grids in the face of climate change. Global shortages of crucial electrical equipment like transformers and circuit breakers don’t make that question any easier to figure out. In part because the transition to renewable energy will require many more sites of power generation than the old-powered system, each new power plant requires its own equipment.",http://res.cloudinary.com/drwsupfyj/image/upload/v1728700265/state-of-the-earth/news_photographs/hurricanehelenebroughtdevastationandanopportunitytoappalachiaspowergrids.jpg
283,2024-10-08 10:30:00,Grist,https://grist.org/technology/the-solar-supply-chain-runs-through-this-flooded-north-carolina-town/,The solar supply chain runs through this flooded North Carolina town,Crisis & Disasters,Sustainability,"Due to a quirk of geology, the purest quartz in all the world comes from the picturesque town of Spruce Pine, North Carolina. The mineral, created deep within the Earth when silicon-rich magmas cooled and crystallized some 370 million years ago, is essential to the production of computer chips and solar panels . China, India, and Russia provide high-purity quartz as well, but what’s mined there does not match the quality or quantity of what lies beneath the Blue Ridge Mountains. With Spruce Pine among the scores of Appalachian communities reeling from Hurricane Helene , the sudden closure of quartz mines that have supplied chip manufacturers for decades has rattled the global tech industry. But this quartz is vital to the solar industry , too. And while industry experts expect companies to withstand the temporary closure of the town’s two mines, it highlights the precariousness of a clean energy economy that relies on materials produced at a single location — especially in a world of increasingly ferocious natural disasters.   Helene’s impact on Spruce Pine “absolutely lays bare the danger of having a monopoly in any part of the supply chain,” said Debra DeShong, head of corporate communications at solar manufacturer QCells North America. QCells, which manufactures photovoltaic panels in Georgia and is building an additional facility that will manufacture the components needed to assemble them, is evaluating whether the Spruce Pine mine closures will impact it. The industry relies on quartz primarily to make polysilicon , a highly refined type of silicon that forms the sunlight-harvesting cells in most photovoltaic panels . But the quartz from Spruce Pine serves another purpose: It is used to make the crucibles in which molten polysilicon crystallizes into cylindrical or rectangular ingots. Those rods are cut into the solar wafers that are further processed to produce the cells within panels. Forming solar ingots requires heating polysilicon to over 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. Only the highest purity quartz sand provides the thermal stability needed to create the crucibles capable of enduring such heat, and the best of it is found in western North Carolina. “Spruce Pine is a very unusual quartz deposit and it is incredibly pure,” said Jenny Chase, the lead solar analyst at energy consultancy BloombergNEF. BloombergNEF estimates that Spruce Pine supplies more than 80 percent of the ultra-pure quartz sand used to manufacture crucibles for both the solar and the semiconductor industry, as well as for optical and lighting applications. (There isn’t any public data on how much of the town’s quartz is used by each sector, but BloombergNEF estimates that in China, the world’s leading producer of photovoltaic panels, 80 percent of the high-purity quartz it uses goes into solar applications.) Spruce Pine dominates this market and supplies nearly all of the material that lines the inside of solar crucibles, which come in direct contact with molten silicon. There, purity is particularly important for ensuring high ingot yields and long crucible lifespans. The amount of quartz required to support solar crucible production is fairly small. Chase says that Spruce Pine produced about 20,000 tons of high-purity quartz sand last year — more than enough to satisfy the demands of the solar industry. That same year, global polysilicon production stood at 1.52 million metric tons. Producing that much polysilicon likely required about 3 million metric tons of quartz, according to Chase. All of which is to say, Spruce Pine is, she said, “quite a small cog” in the solar supply chain. Still, a small cog can become a big problem if there are no contingencies when it breaks down. But Chase suspects that most crucible manufacturers — an industry based largely in East Asia — have stockpiles of high-purity quartz. May Haugen, who leads communications at The Quartz Corp, a Norwegian company that produces high-purity quartz sand at Spruce Pine, confirmed this in an email to Grist. “The Quartz Corp operates in long value chains where everybody has learnt through COVID the importance of sizable safety stocks,” Haugen wrote. “Between our own safety stocks, which are built in different locations, and the ones down in the value chain, we are not concerned about shortages in the short or medium term.” In preparation for Hurricane Helene, The Quartz Corp halted all mining operations in Spruce Pine on September 26. So did the Belgian firm Sibelco, the town’s other producer. It is unclear when either company will resume mining: In an October 2 statement, The Quartz Corp wrote that while its plants do not seem to have been seriously damaged by the storm, it is still “too early to tell” when they will reopen, “as this will also depend on the rebuilding of local infrastructure.” In an October 4 statement shared with Grist, Sibelco wrote that its facilities appear to have sustained “minor damage” and that the company hopes to “restart operations as soon as we can.” “Our dedicated teams are on-site, conducting cleanup,” the statement noted. “Our final product stock has not been impacted.” The company declined to say how the hurricane could impact its plan to double production capacity in Spruce Pine by 2025. Even if both mines remain shuttered for months, the solar industry could adapt, Chase said. The Japanese firm Mitsubishi Chemical Group manufactures high-purity synthetic silica for the semiconductor industry, and the material meets the standards required for solar crucibles, according to Chase. However, production would need to ramp up. Mitsubishi Chemical Group representative Kana Nuruki told Grist in an email that the company currently does not have enough synthetic quartz to support the solar industry, and what it does produce is “considerably more expensive” than the real thing. Paying a premium for synthetic quartz would be a challenge for the price-sensitive solar industry, Chase said. “But if it had no choice, it would do it.” Developing alternative supplies of high-purity quartz, even ones that cost more, could help fortify the solar supply chain against the next climate-fueled disaster. “As solar becomes a larger piece of our electrification, it’s going to be increasingly important that we ensure we have a stable supply chain,” DeShong of QCells said. Still, manufacturing both semiconductors and solar panels in the U.S. is a key priority of the Biden administration, and it seems unlikely that Washington will want to see a critical cog in both supply chains move overseas. A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Energy told Grist that the agency “is closely monitoring Hurricane Helene’s effects [on] the supply chain,” while “advancing efforts to maintain the stability of America’s energy systems.” Spencer Bost, executive director of the community development organization Downtown Spruce Pine , said that quartz-mining operations are the largest private employer in the county and restarting it quickly is “very important from a local economy perspective.” If the federal government cares about building clean energy in America, Bost said, “we have all the stuff here.” “We have the people who need the jobs here,” he added.

539,2024-10-07 19:29:31,Grist,https://grist.org/housing/helene-manufactured-housing-mobile-homes-florida-big-bend/,"For Floridians in mobile homes, Hurricane Helene was a disaster waiting to happen",Crisis & Disasters,Society & Culture,"Chelsy Robison huddled in an empty building on the Paradise Park mobile home campground in Perry, Florida, on the evening of September 26, listening as 140 miles-per-hour winds tore through the state’s Big Bend region. Robison, recovering from hernia surgery; her boyfriend, Steve; and their dog, Judah, had abandoned their violently shaking trailer just a few hours earlier, fearing it would not survive the storm. The next morning, as the worst of the winds died down, they emerged to find that Hurricane Helene had left behind a world of damage: Fragments of one neighbor’s walls littered the grass, roof panels had been ripped clean off a communal building, and a trailer just a few dozen feet from her own had been flipped entirely upside down. In the distance, a sea of downed power lines and felled trees covered the mobile home park’s 8 acres. Her trailer sat amid the calamitous scene, miraculously unscathed.   Robison was relieved. She had lost everything the year before when Hurricane Idalia, another Category 4, bore down on Taylor County and caused a tree to crash through her manufactured home. That’s how she ended up at Paradise Park in the first place, living in a temporary trailer issued to her by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “It’s just a little bit of damage. It ain’t too much. It ain’t like Idalia,” said Robison, which crushed her trailer “like a can.” “We just living, man. I just hope ain’t nothing else gonna come through here.” Not even two weeks later, Florida’s Big Bend communities are now preparing for Hurricane Milton, a rapidly intensifying system forecasted to bring life-threatening storm surge and winds later this week to many of the same areas devastated by Helene. Florida’s Big Bend is nestled into the crook of the state’s Gulf Coast, largely underdeveloped and lower-income. A huge share of the region’s residents live in manufactured housing. In Taylor County, where Helene made landfall and where Milton is expected to inflict damage, more than a third of the housing stock consists of prefab units, according to census data. Many of the counties in southern Georgia, where Helene’s eye moved next, have a similar mix. And in western North Carolina, where the storm’s heavy rain caused mass flooding and landslides, around 15 percent of housing stock is manufactured — nearly triple the national average. Communities like Robison’s — littered with crumpled trailers, scraped-off aluminum siding, and waterlogged campers — now serve as acute examples of how the climate and housing crises in the United States overlap. Because of how mobile home units are anchored and the materials typically used to build them, manufactured houses are among the most vulnerable types of housing stock in climate disasters. They aren’t rooted as deeply into the ground, which means they can flip or collapse during wind events, and they tend to have thinner exteriors and insulation than site-built homes, which mean they are more vulnerable to leakage and the spread of mold. These problems are far more common with “mobile homes,” or manufactured homes built before the launch of 1970s-era construction guidelines, but they also exist in more recent models. A ballooning shortage of affordable housing has pushed more people into manufactured homes at the same time that extreme weather like hurricanes are becoming more severe. Victims of climate disasters also often find themselves turning to manufactured homes in the absence of other housing stock — perpetuating a cycle of substandard living and displacement. Making matters even worse is that many mobile home residents, like those at Paradise Park, don’t own the land underneath their house. “Families who live in manufactured home parks, their rate of poverty is about three times as much as people who have conventional housing,” said Andrew Rumbach, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who studies household and community risk to hazards and climate change. They also either lack insurance, or are underinsured, further magnifying their chance of long-term economic disruption from a hurricane like Helene. People in these situations additionally often confront “really complicated issues” in financing a home, he noted. “You can’t get a conventional mortgage on a manufactured home in most states, including Florida, because it’s not ‘real property.’ It’s what we call ‘chattel property’ or personal property,” he said. This key distinction makes it harder for those trying to rebuild a manufactured home after a disaster, because it can be more difficult to get aid, particularly when such properties are purchased informally through private sales, Rumbach said. People living in mobile home parks across the nation also often find themselves ineligible for recovery programs like buyouts because they don’t own the land below their structures. Florida has more manufactured homes than almost any other state in the country. An estimated 12 percent of the housing stock in Helene’s path in Florida, spread across 21 counties, is made up of mobile or manufactured homes, according to an analysis provided to Grist by researchers at the Urban Institute. More than a third of those are rentals. The proportion is far higher in the Big Bend, where the storm made landfall, and in South Carolina, where it also brought damaging winds. These homes once provided an alternative for those who couldn’t afford traditional housing, but climate change is stripping them of being this lifeline, a refuge. The cost of the average manufactured home has risen alongside the cost of building materials like wood and aluminum, and many people who lost their mobile homes during 2023’s Hurricane Idalia have struggled to purchase or rent new ones. “The prices of mobile homes [have gone] up significantly since COVID,” said Leon Wright, the building director for Dixie County, where more than half of the housing stock consists of manufactured homes, one of the highest rates in the nation. “It’s not as affordable as it once was.” Dixie lost 130 houses to Idalia last year, and it still has yet to repair many of them. Wright said Helene destroyed far more. One of the largest providers of manufactured homes in the Big Bend is none other than FEMA itself, which deploys them to house storm victims like Robison. The agency tends to use these units, known colloquially as “FEMA trailers,” when it cannot find enough traditional housing in a given disaster area. FEMA has drawn criticism in the past for relying on travel trailers rather than relocating disaster victims into standard homes or apartments, and for being too slow to provide these trailers. States like Louisiana have begun to buy and ship in their own manufactured homes after big storms in order to avoid federal red tape, and Florida’s top emergency official said that he would seek to do the same after Helene. Hundreds of these trailers have become a part of the Big Bend’s manufactured housing ecosystem since Idalia, and more will arrive soon following Helene, and likely Milton. Todd Mikola, the owner of Paradise Park, told Grist two days after landfall that he is planning to clear trees and crush damaged trailers to make room for more FEMA trailers — he was in the midst of moving trees away from the former home of a woman who had lost her job and fallen behind on rent. “I want to beautify the place,” said Mikola, who lives in Germany and bought the trailer park three years ago. He had flown in from Germany just a few days before the storm and was planning to leave town a few days later. He told Grist that Helene hadn’t damaged the park — omitting mention of the flipped and damaged trailers or the transformers that burst in Helene’s immediate aftermath. FEMA only rents its mobile home units to storm victims for 18 months, but trailers often become a dead-end for displaced people, who in many cases cannot find affordable housing long after the disaster. A 2022 analysis by The New York Times found that a large share of victims from recent hurricanes, such as 2020’s Laura and 2021’s Ida, remained in trailers even as FEMA wound down its aid for those storms. Tony Lacey, who also lives in a FEMA trailer just next door to Robison in Paradise Park, said he had no idea what he would do if the agency kicked him out of his home in February, the 18-month anniversary of Idalia. That storm had destroyed his home in the coastal town of Keaton Beach, landing him in Paradise Park. In the year since, he has been unable to find a job in the area, and his car permanently broke down. The agency hasn’t been receptive to his attempts to purchase the structure. “They didn’t even talk to me about it,” he said. “[FEMA] said, ‘You don’t have income.’ And they’re intimidating when you talk to them.” A spokesperson for FEMA did not respond to Grist’s requests for comment by publication, citing the demands of the agency’s ongoing emergency response to Helene. Robison has also been stuck in a waiting game with the agency ever since she moved in last November, unsure when or if it will force her out of her home, out of Paradise Park. “I don’t know if they ain’t getting it, or they don’t understand, or I don’t know,” she said, “but I would like for them to give us these campers, because we don’t have homes to go to.” Campers and mobile homes are an affordable backup for many families in areas with scarce housing, but some residents in disaster areas are starting to see them as a permanent solution — a way to avoid the high cost of building to flood and wind standards. When a home suffers significant damage during a storm, federal regulations require the homeowner to rebuild it to a higher flood standard. For coastal homeowners on the Big Bend, that can mean elevating as much as 18 or 20 feet in the air — an expensive and lengthy process. Those who can’t afford to elevate are turning to manufactured housing. Coastal residents can bring campers onto their land and erect “pole barns,” or rudimentary roof shelters, to protect them from the elements. Because these homes aren’t permanent structures, they aren’t subject to local building codes or insurance mandates. When big storms come, the owners can just drive them to higher ground for a few days. Wright said more coastal residents in his county are turning to campers and that he understands why, given the stringency of state and federal building codes designed to protect against flood and wind damage. “You always see it,” he said. “People lose freedoms in the name of security or safety.” He went on to refer to the building codes as “borderline communism.” He added, however, that the conversion of many homes to camper parking spaces could deal a big hit to the Dixie County budget, which relies to a great extent on property tax revenue from coastal homes. The taxable value of a pole barn lot is much lower than that of an actual house. Rumbach, the hazard and housing expert, worries about more residents utilizing this sort of largely unregulated manufactured housing. The financial strain of hurricanes, he said, compounded by a shortage of affordable housing, could force people to make decisions that put them at greater risk during future disasters. “I worry about [this] being maladaptation,” he said. “I’m concerned that the outcome of this storm could be that we are more vulnerable next time, not less.” Clint and Brooke Hiers, longtime residents of Horseshoe Beach, a town of just 170 people, are considering a transition to this tentative form of housing. After evacuating to higher ground ahead of Helene, they drove back to their seaside community in Dixie County on Friday to find it reduced to a maze of splinters and debris. Their home, which was elevated around 5 feet, had been pushed off its pilings by storm surge and fallen into a neighbor’s yard. Brooke’s sister’s house next door had been sheared apart by the water. “You can’t rebuild down here, because if you do, you got to go to code,” said Clint, staring at what remained of his house, stuck in a stand of waterlogged trees. He estimated that elevating his house to 18 feet would cost a few hundred thousand dollars. Even then, he would still have to pay more than $10,000 a year for flood and windstorm insurance, assuming insurance companies would sell it to him. Given those costs, it seemed far easier for him and Brooke to adopt a more tentative form of residence on the coast. “I could take that lot and build a pretty good-sized pole barn to put a camper on,” he said. “Then when the storm comes, you just pull it out. You don’t have to have insurance. That’s what everybody’s going to after Idalia — a lot of people already did that down here.” As Brooke examined the damage, she seemed to be thinking along the same lines. “Everybody’s bone-ass broke right now from everything we had to do for Idalia,” she said. “We are broke, broke. Spent all our savings. And now it’s just gone.” ","Hurricane Helene left behind a world of damage in Florida's Big Bend region. A huge share of the region’s residents live in manufactured housing.

411,2024-10-07 23:46:26,Grist,https://grist.org/extreme-weather/hurricane-milton-exploded-intensification-storm/,How Hurricane Milton exploded into an ‘extraordinary’ storm,Climate Change,Public Health & Environment,"​ Less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene tore through the Southeastern United States , killing more than 200 people and causing perhaps hundreds of billions of dollars in property and economic damage, Hurricane Milton has spun up in the Gulf of Mexico and taken aim at Florida. On Monday, Milton reached Category 5 status with winds reaching as high as 180 mph , and it’s expected to cause widespread flooding with torrential rainfall and a towering storm surge when it makes landfall, likely around Tampa Bay on Wednesday. How Milton got to this point is even more remarkable. A hurricane undergoes “rapid intensification” if its sustained wind speeds jump by at least 35 miles per hour within 24 hours. Helene did that before making landfall in the Big Bend region of Florida’s west coast. But Milton’s intensification has been nothing short of explosive: Wind speeds skyrocketed by 90 mph in 24 hours — at one point managing a 70-mph leap in just 13 hours — leaving meteorologists and researchers stunned .   It’s one of the fastest intensification events scientists have ever observed in the Atlantic. Even sophisticated hurricane models didn’t see it coming . “This is definitely extraordinary,” said Karthik Balaguru, a climate scientist who studies hurricanes at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. “The storm barely formed on October 5, and on October 7, it is a Cat 5 hurricane. That is very impressive.” Like Helene before it, Milton formed under the perfect conditions for rapid intensification. A hurricane’s fuel is high ocean temperatures, and the Gulf of Mexico has been a warm bath in recent months, with temperatures over 80 degrees Fahrenheit, well above average figures . “Sea surface temperatures in this area are near record, if not record-breaking,” said Daniel Gilford, who studies hurricanes at Climate Central, a nonprofit research organization. “It’s a little bit difficult to say, actually.” That’s because of an unfortunate irony: Hurricane Helene devastated Asheville, North Carolina, where the National Centers for Environmental Information stores data on ocean temperatures. “The sea surface temperature data that we rely on to make our day-to-day climate attribution calculations is actually unavailable to us,” said Gilford. “It’s been down for about 11 days now because of Hurricane Helene.” Losing access to that data is making it harder to calculate how much climate change has contributed to Milton’s intensification. But Gilford can say with confidence that the sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico were made at least 100 times more likely because of climate change, and that’s a conservative estimate. Hurricanes also like high humidity, which Milton has plenty of. And low wind shear — winds moving at different speeds at various heights in the atmosphere — meant Milton could organize and spin up nicely. “There’s nothing to impede the storm from the atmospheric standpoint,” Balaguru said. Milton’s extreme intensification has the fingerprints of climate change all over it. For one, as the atmosphere warms, so too do the oceans, providing vast pools of fuel for hurricanes. Scientists are also finding that changes in atmospheric patterns have been decreasing wind shear in coastal regions. A difference in temperature between the land and sea also creates circulation patterns that boost the amount of humidity in the atmosphere. So with higher humidity, warmer oceans, and weaker wind shear, hurricanes have everything they need to rapidly intensify into monsters. Indeed, scientists are finding a dramatic increase in the number of rapid intensification events close to shore in recent years. That makes hurricanes all the more dangerous: A coastal community might be preparing to ride out a Category 1 storm only for an unsurvivable Category 5 to suddenly come ashore. In general, a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, so hurricanes have more moisture to wring out as rain. A recent study found that climate change caused Helene to dump 50 percent more rainfall in parts of Georgia and the Carolinas. Gilford expects climate change to also boost the rainfall that Milton dumps on Florida. Like Helene did in Big Bend, Milton is expected to bulldoze ashore a storm surge of perhaps 15 feet along Florida’s west coast. That’s in part a consequence of the gentle slope from the coast out into the Gulf of Mexico: If the water were deeper, the storm surge could flow into the depths. But in this case, the storm surge has nowhere to go but inland. The surge in Tampa Bay could be especially dangerous, since it acts like an overflowing bowl. As a result, the National Weather Service is warning that Milton could be the worst storm to hit the Tampa area in more than a century. Milton might not just be an immediate emergency for Florida — it could well be a harbinger of the supercharged hurricanes to come.

795,2024-10-07 10:15:00,Grist,https://grist.org/regulation/how-california-boosted-composting-but-broke-local-composters-in-the-process/,How California boosted composting — but broke local composters in the process,Sustainability,Public Health & Environment,"Reporting for this story was supported by the Climate Equity Reporting Project at the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism. In the first few years after Monique Figueiredo founded Compostable LA in 2019, it grew rapidly. The small business picked up food scraps from homes, event spaces, and businesses — ranging from Walmart to Nike — and delivered it to urban farms and community gardens where it was made into high-quality compost. It wasn’t long before the venture had more than 1,000 customers throughout the city of Los Angeles.   Figueiredo’s business diverted food waste from landfills while educating young people, corporations, and consumers about the value of composting and providing free compost to more than a dozen urban farms and gardens that feed people in some of the city’s most marginalized communities. Then, in 2022, cities around California began implementing SB 1383, a law that requires them to contract with large waste hauling companies to pick up food scraps at the curb, along with garbage and recycling, and transport it to industrial-scale composting facilities outside the city. The law aims to cut organic waste in landfills by 75 percent by 2025 and is on its way to doing so, but it has also had unintended consequences for community composting operations across the state. Within weeks, Compostable LA’s residential customers began to cancel their memberships. The city had signed contracts with a few large haulers who bundled their green bin service with the other two, and all customers were charged regardless of whether they used it. Many of Compostable LA’s members couldn’t afford to pay for two services, they told Figueiredo. The company was hit hard, and by late August 2024, with only 400 customers left, it had to stop providing residential services. Figueiredo laid off her eight-person staff. And while it may continue providing the services to some businesses and events, she’s not optimistic about the company’s future. After years of advocating within Los Angeles and at the state level for a place at the table among larger waste management companies, she feels incredibly worn down. “Even if this business continues to be viable, I don’t know if I’m viable anymore,” she said. If Compostable LA shuts down, she added, “it is directly correlated to uninclusive policies.” The composting law is causing a sea change in California. Since 2022, the year the law took effect, the number of cities, towns, and other jurisdictions with access to residential food and yard waste collection jumped from 50 percent to nearly 80 percent. And still more are working on complying. According to the public recycling and compost management agency CalRecycle , the state has more than 200 organic waste processing facilities and is building 20 more to accommodate the flood of food scraps expected. These measures are diverting significant quantities of waste from landfills and reducing the amount of methane , a potent greenhouse gas released when food scraps decompose, entering the atmosphere. But community composting groups and their advocates argue that its implementation is also hampering urban farming programs and educational programs in the communities that need it most. The introduction of large haulers in many cities, they say, has pushed community composting to the margins, and limited it mainly to drop-off hubs, which by nature only reach the most dedicated participants willing to haul their waste to predetermined sites. Community composting has several environmental and public health benefits. Industrially made compost is often contaminated with herbicides from yard waste to PFAS from additives like food packaging, paper products, and compostable to-go ware . Due to its poor quality, urban farmers typically don’t use it to grow food on its own. “Commercially made compost is good, but you have to amend it with a whole bunch of other things to bring it to the level where it will grow food for you,” said Sarah Boltwala-Mesina, who runs the San Diego-based composting business Food2Soil, which is also struggling to remain viable after scaling its operations down post-SB 1383. Even CalRecycle refers to the compost made in smaller community-led facilities as “ a nutritious superfood .” Smaller composting sites also create educational programs that engage urban residents in understanding the complete life cycle of the food they eat. On the other hand, community composting advocates say industrial haulers tend to treat compost as a commodity and focus on diverting the largest quantities in order to maximize profit. They also sell the finished product primarily to large rural farms rather than urban farmers and gardeners. Community composting is relatively new, but it has exploded nationally in recent years.  A survey conducted by The Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit organization that supports sustainable community development, found that half of the 86 composting groups that responded had started since 2016. The group maintains a map of more than 200 groups across the U.S. Many are still working at a hyper-local neighborhood scale, but some have grown to serve larger portions of their communities. These efforts have received significant local and federal support. In California, community composting has seen unprecedented investment from the Inflation Reduction Act , a 2022 law that directed more than $300 billion toward clean energy and environmental projects . Last year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture also awarded $11.5 million in funds from the American Rescue Plan Act to 38 cooperative agreements focused on reducing food waste, and about a third involved community composting. With more federal funding coming down the pipeline, community composting “has the potential to boom,” said Clarissa Libertelli, who runs a national coalition of community composting groups for the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. But, she added, it’s unclear whether the growing interest in composting as a climate solution will help small-scale composters grow, “or if it’s going to instead channel money to big industrial players that are pushing them out of the scene.” In San Diego, Boltwala-Mesina said she had been looking forward to the implementation of the composting law and assumed it would give her program a boost. Instead, she said, “the bundling of services is basically killing us.” For the multiple community and youth-centered urban agriculture programs her compost supports, the loss has had a reverberating effect. “All these programs that were designed around gardening for the disadvantaged and underrepresented sections of society, they all become meaningless without our ability to make healthy soil,” she said. Figueiredo and others compare composting choices to the options available for fresh produce. In many cities, those who can’t make it to the farmers market but want to support local farmers can sign up for memberships with farms that deliver local produce to their homes. “You can’t do that with composting,” she said. “[Policymakers] are saying, ‘Either take this inconvenient option, which is a drop-off site, or participate in the industrialized system.’” On a Monday morning early this summer, Michael Martinez, the founder of LA Compost, was working with a group of volunteers to combine a few hundred pounds of newly collected food scraps with wood chips near the base of a popular hiking trail in Los Angeles’ Griffith Park. The scraps had been collected at farmers markets over the weekend, and most had been dropped off by apartment dwellers in multi-unit buildings without green bin service. LA Compost currently has locations like these in three parks, and they’re planning for a total of seven by the end of the year. The nonprofit employs 35 people, runs a robust education program, and works with a large team of volunteers. It has received multiple grants to continue its work, including one for $400,000 from the federal Department of Agriculture. The group has filled a key gap in Los Angeles since the rollout of the California composting law. The sanitation department runs a service that reaches only a fraction of the single-family homes in the county, Martinez said. Most apartment buildings don’t have green bins, he added, and “the large majority of Angelenos are in multifamily units.” Nick Lapis, director of advocacy for Californians Against Waste, an environmental nonprofit, said he understands why tension exists between the large waste haulers and those in the community composting world. Most big haulers have had to make expensive changes to green their fleets and hire unionized workers in recent years, largely due to regulatory pressure. “Historically, the waste haulers have been really concerned about people coming in, not having to meet any of those same requirements, and going to their customer and [undercutting their prices],” he said. Lapis believes community composters can coexist with big haulers if they focus mainly on their role as educators. “It’s really hard to top a community composter working in places like schools, where they can compost waste on-site and use it to grow food they eat,” he added. Drop-off sites like the one LA Compost operates appear to be the most viable option for community composters moving forward, despite being much less convenient. Kourtnii Brown, the co-founder and CEO of the California Alliance for Community Composting, has helped establish 250 new composting hubs since 2020. They are all small drop-off sites and spaces where food waste is generated on-site. In this landscape, community composting projects can grow, Brown said, as long they take a distributed spoke-and-wheel approach that involves small, neighborhood-scale hubs and reframe what they do, making it clear that they’re not trying to compete with big waste haulers. “We prefer to say that we never deal in waste at all,” she said. “This is resource recovery work. We are taking material and using it to feed animals, to feed people if it’s still edible, but also to feed the local soil.” ","In 2022, California cities began implementing SB 1383, a law that requires them to contract with large waste hauling companies. The law aims to cut organic waste in landfills by 75 percent by 2025 and is on its way to doing so. But it has also had unintended consequences for community composting operations across the state. By late August 2024, with only 400 customers left, Compostable LA had to stop providing residential services. The company laid off its eight-person staff and founder Monique Figueiredo is not optimistic about its future.",http://res.cloudinary.com/drwsupfyj/image/upload/v1728700288/state-of-the-earth/news_photographs/howcaliforniaboostedcompostingbutbrokelocalcompostersintheprocess.jpg
923,2024-10-07 10:00:00,Grist,https://grist.org/indigenous/indigenous-voters-harris-presidency-endangering-sacred-lands/,Indigenous voters worry a Harris presidency means endangering sacred lands,Politics & Law,Public Health & Environment,"At an August rally in Glendale, Arizona, the rowdiness of the crowd suggested a rockstar was about to take the stage. Instead, a booming voice welcomed the spectators with a full-throated endorsement of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris: “She is the right person at the right time to be our country’s 47th president!” The voice belonged to Governor of the Gila River Indian Community Stephen Roe Lewis, a tribal leader who helped resolve long overdue water rights in the state for the tribe last year. “Skoden!” Later on, after a warm-up speech from running mate Tim Walz, Vice President Harris took the stage, saying she would “always honor tribal sovereignty and respect tribal self-determination,” (The 22 federally recognized tribes in Arizona make an Indigenous voting block that proved essential to President Joe Biden’s win in the swing state in 2020.) On her campaign website, she maintains that she will work to secure America’s industrial future by investing in clean energy — but clean energy development often negatively impacts sites on federal lands that are sacred to Indigenous peoples.   The Biden-Harris administration has been one of the most supportive of Native peoples, investing millions of dollars of federal funding for climate resilience and green energy initiatives . Still, the Indigenous vote for Harris in 2024 is far from assured. While the U.S. has big goals on its path to a clean energy future , those plans have to compete against the preservation of tribal lands — an issue Harris has stumbled over in her political career, dating back to her time as California’s attorney general. Almost 80 miles east of the Arizona rally, a sacred site is in danger. Oak Flat, a swath of national forest land in the high desert, has been an important spiritual site for tribes like the San Carlos Apache for centuries, and is used for ceremonies and gathering medicines like sage, bear root, and greasewood. Yet the area is under threat — Rio Tinto, an international mining company, has been fighting to put a copper mine there for more than a decade . Oak Flat is home to one of the planet’s largest undeveloped copper reserves, and the metal is critical to making the electric batteries necessary for the shift to cleaner energy sources. Oak Flat and other sacred sites have not been given enough federal protections, activists say, despite intense advocacy from the tribal nations affected. Much of the U.S. has already been built and powered at the expense of tribal lands and peoples. To reach its goal of 80 percent renewable energy generation by 2030, and carbon-free electricity five years after that, the U.S. needs big investments and robust policy support. While Harris says she is the candidate in the best position to achieve those goals, there is a concern among Indigenous communities that doing so will continue to exploit tribal homelands — most of the minerals needed for the energy transition are located within 35 miles of away from tribal communities , on lands originally stolen from them. “They definitely are hard to do at the same time. That’s the conflict,” said Dov Korff-Korn, an attorney at Lakota People’s Law Project and Sacred Defense Fund, of the balance between extracting the minerals critical to the energy transition and protecting tribal lands where many such minerals are located. He mentioned that Harris has few environmental policies of her own to critique, and that, policy-wise, the broader Biden-Harris administration has been a mixed bag. “There’s been a lot of positive signs that should be recognized and applauded. But it’s also been a continuation of a lot of the same old extractive policies that have powered America for pretty much its entire history.” In a bid to protect some places from industry, President Biden flexed his ability to make national monuments out of sacred sites, such as the Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon National Monument — or Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni — as well as to fully restore the boundaries of the Bears Ears monument in Utah from a Trump-era rollback. Biden also appointed the first-ever Native American to his Cabinet — Deb Haaland, Pueblo of Laguna — as the head of the Department of Interior. In her role, Haaland has instructed federal agencies to incorporate traditional knowledge in order to better protect Indigenous sacred sites on public land. During her tenure as vice president, Harris has been party to the administration’s push to produce more oil and gas than ever, despite promises to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 . Last year, the Biden administration also gave the green light to the Willow project, an $8 billion dollar drilling operation on Alaska’s North Slope that some, but not all , tribes were against. Throughout her presidential campaign, and in a reversal of her previous stance, Harris has showed support for fracking , a controversial drilling method that extracts oil and natural gas from deep within the ground. Crystal Cavalier-Keck, a member of the Occoneechee Band of the Saponi Nation in South Carolina, is the co-founder of 7 Directions of Service , an Indigenous-led environmental justice organization. She’s concerned that the Mountain Valley Pipeline, currently a 303-mile system that runs through West Virginia and Virginia, will permanently damage the sacred Haw River where she has many memories with her family. Over the years, the beleaguered river has been polluted by chemicals and is now threatened by the pipeline, which began operations in June. In 2020, Cavalier-Keck campaigned for Biden in South Carolina but didn’t see movement on the environmental protections she wanted after he got elected. She said she will still vote for Harris in November but feels like her concerns are not being talked about. “There’s not much at all on her environmental policies,” she said. “They’re saying the right buzzwords, like ‘clean, renewable, forward.’ But where’s the meat of it?” She lives about a two-hour drive from where Hurricane Helene has claimed more than 100 lives in North Carolina, and she worries that the next big climate disaster will reach her community. Cavalier-Keck said that her tribe has had issues accessing the roughly $120 million in federal funding to help tribes build climate resilience. During Harris’ time as attorney general of California, she argued against tribes putting land into trust , a process that can protect land as well as allow economic development like casinos where gambling might be banned, claiming the situation only applies if a tribe was “under federal jurisdiction” when the Indian Reorganization Act was passed in the 1930s. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Harris and the state , but had she won the case, about 100 tribes in California would not have been allowed to benefit from trust lands. Still, Lael Echo Hawk, who is Pawnee and an expert in tribal law, says Harris’ decisions as attorney general aren’t reflective of what she might be capable of as president. She pointed out that as attorney general, Harris helped pass a red flag law in California to take away firearms from people deemed dangerous. Plus, she called on the U.S. Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act — an issue important in Native communities, where women go missing and are the survivors of violence at a rate higher than the national average. Echo Hawk also knows of tribes concerned with border issues and immigration that are endorsing Harris. “These are important issues that I think better demonstrate her commitment to advancing and protecting tribal sovereignty,” Echo Hawk said. But for Nick Estes, a member of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe and a professor at the University of Minnesota, Harris might just be a continuation of the Biden administration, which he maintains has taken advantage of tribal lands. As it stands today, 1.6 million surface and subsurface acres of land within 83 reservations have non-Natives benefiting from oil, gas, and mining operations, among other extractive industries. “You can’t just have a vibes-based environmental policy. It actually needs to be concrete,” said Estes. “What we’ve seen is just service to industry at the expense of Native lands and livelihoods.” ","Kamala Harris says she will work to secure America’s industrial future by investing in clean energy. Clean energy development often negatively impacts sites on federal lands that are sacred to Indigenous peoples.

1051,2024-10-06 15:00:00,Grist,https://grist.org/drought/in-arid-new-mexico-a-debate-over-reusing-oil-industry-wastewater/,"In arid New Mexico, a debate over reusing oil-industry wastewater",Public Health & Environment,Sustainability,"This year, the New Mexico Water Quality Control Commission held a hearing in Santa Fe to seek public input on regulating wastewater discharge from the oil and gas industry. It ended up dealing a blow to Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham’s ambitious proposal to reuse the water for alternative energy development. Under the proposal, which was announced a few months earlier at the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference and dubbed the “ Strategic Water Supply ,” the state would buy both natural brackish and oilfield-produced water, contract with private companies for treatment or cleaning, and then provide the cleaned water to so-called green industries like solar and wind energy and electric vehicle manufacturing. The $500 million investment, Lujan Grisham said at the U.N. conference, would help “strengthen our climate resiliency and protect our precious freshwater resources.” But the majority of the public who attended the hearing or submitted written comments opposed any discharge of either treated or untreated produced water, with some calling the water toxic and contaminated. New Mexico Water Quality Control Commissioner Katie Zemlick summarized the concerns of many citizens: Given the lack of reliable data on the chemicals found in the industrially produced water, “Why would we want to move forward with applications that could potentially interact with ground or surface water?” Some environmental and Indigenous activists also panned the proposal, with activists calling it a “false solution” that funnels money to the oil and gas industry. And during the 2024 legislative session, a bill to fund the project received little support from lawmakers, and died in committee. All the while, the state hasn’t give up: The New Mexico Environment Department (under which the Water Quality Control Commission falls) collected information from the private and public sectors on treatment and industrial reuse of produced water, a preliminary step before requesting and accepting proposals under the plan. And at the hearing they pursued new rules for the use of produced water in pilot projects. Mike Hightower, program director of the New Mexico Produced Water Research Consortium, a partnership between academia, government agencies, national laboratories, the private sector, and the state, testified that “the data available on produced water overwhelmingly shows that it can be treated and used safely.” Other oil-producing Western states are also grappling with how to manage increasing volumes of produced water, given intensifying drought and dwindling storage options. New Mexico is at the center of the debate because of the lucrative Permian Basin, which extends from West Texas into southeastern New Mexico. The Permian is the nation’s most productive oilfield, accounting for over 40 percent of total U.S. oil production. It also generates the most wastewater — more than 15 million barrels per day in 2022, over 10 times more than the next-highest producing basin. James Kenney, the New Mexico Environment Department secretary, emphasized in an interview that the state is not proposing reuse for drinking water or agriculture. But using produced water for hydrogen fuel development or solar projects, he said, “seems like a great way to offset freshwater use.” Currently, he added, most produced water is injected back underground, and it’s “a real missed opportunity” not to reuse it. But public health advocates are concerned. Ted Schettler, science director at the Science and Environmental Health Network, a nonprofit group, said that “produced water is highly toxic.” In addition to known carcinogens like formaldehyde, he said, produced water presents “reproductive hazards, developmental hazards, neurotoxic hazards” to humans. The Permian wastewater surge is the result of a boom in fracking — an extractive technique in which fluid is pumped into wells at high pressure to break open tight rock formations and release oil and gas deposits. As of 2022, around 95 percent of the Permian’s oil and gas wells were horizontal wells , which extend horizontally below the surface, and typically fracked, up from around 20 percent in 2011. Along with hydrocarbons, large quantities of water are brought to the surface with a host of naturally occurring substances, like salts, metals, and oil and grease, as well as chemicals added by fuel companies. The region’s enormous volume of wastewater and “high current and projected levels of water scarcity makes the Permian a key location” of regulation and research, according to a 2023 report from the Ground Water Protection Council, a nonprofit composed of state groundwater regulatory agencies. For now, regulation is left to Western states under the federal Clean Water Act, which authorizes beneficial reuse of water “of good enough quality” in states west of the 98th meridian, which roughly demarcates the arid West. Some states have already approved some reuse of produced water outside oilfields, though not for green energy and without the significant investment proposed by New Mexico. In California, produced water is used for irrigation in the Central Valley; in Wyoming, it is used for livestock watering and irrigation; and in Pennsylvania, it has been approved for discharge into the Susquehanna River. In Texas, meanwhile, pilot projects are being conducted with cotton irrigation, and the state has permitted discharge to streams and rivers if it meets water quality standards. Texas and Colorado have also created produced water consortiums to study treatment and reuse outside oilfields. Some scientists are calling for more federal oversight of such projects. “It’s almost guaranteed that if the particular state does not require much more rigorous testing, there are going to be hazardous chemicals that are going to be spread on the land, or make their way into waterways,” said Schettler. “I think it’s pretty clear that the current regulatory landscape is not adequate to truly protect public health or the environment because of all these unknowns,” he added. Taimur Shaikh, a senior policy adviser for the Environmental Protection Agency in the New Mexico region, and an adviser to the state’s produced water research consortium, emphasized that the EPA’s involvement in state consortiums working on regulations is minimal: “We’re trying to be engaged in an advisory capacity,” he told Undark. “But we are definitely not trying to steer any of them.” Meanwhile, produced water is “a very valuable water resource,” said Pei Xu, associate director for research and technology at the New Mexico Produced Water Research Consortium. But, she added, it’s necessary to ensure that the treated water “will not cause any risks to human beings and to the environment.” Permian produced water has been found to contain the naturally occurring radioactive metals radium and uranium; other metals like lithium and iron; ammonia; and volatile organic compounds including benzene and toluene. Oil and gas companies also add chemicals to their drilling fluids, including acids to dissolve minerals, biocides to kill bacteria that cause corrosion, surfactants to make the fluid thicker, and polymers to minimize friction during drilling operations. Hightower, the consortium’s program director, said the results of their treatment projects have found “that there is no toxicity of the treated produced waters.” Yet Shaikh of the EPA said that estimating the risk of exposure is challenging, because the chemical makeup depends on the geologic formation the water is drawn from. It’s a “complex mixture” composed of many different materials, he said, and “some have good toxicological data and some don’t.” According to one literature review encompassing 129 studies, out of nearly 1,200 chemicals found in U.S. produced water, only 14 percent had “existing toxicity values” needed for risk assessment. In addition, some of the chemicals are considered proprietary, and aren’t disclosed by oil and gas companies. “If you’re not cleaning up the water with these chemicals in mind, and you’re putting these unknown chemicals onto the landscape in the water,” Schettler said, “it’s very difficult to conclude that you know that it’s safe.” Given produced water’s myriad components, it takes numerous processes to remove them. First, oil and grease must be separated and filtered. Then targeted chemicals are removed with adsorbents — solids that contaminants adhere to, including sawdust and activated carbon. Other substances are removed with ultraviolet disinfection or oxidation. Salts are removed through processes like reverse osmosis or thermal distillation. Finally, if the water is to be used for groundwater recharge to aquifers or potable use, it may also need disinfection or pH adjustment. Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as “ forever chemicals ,” have also been found in Permian produced water, including samples tested by Xu. She speculates it was a result of contamination, but according to a 2023 Physicians for Social Responsibility report , Permian oil and gas operators have injected wells with these chemicals, which are notoriously difficult to remove. “I think it’d be very hard to find one treatment that truly addresses all the components that you might find within produced water,” Shaikh said. Another safety issue, Xu said, is that exposure to the combined chemicals “may have a synergistic effect” that isn’t revealed with analysis of individual chemicals. As a result, Xu and her colleagues have begun toxicity studies to look at the effects of what she calls “the whole effluent” on plants and animals. Hightower said he hoped this toxicity testing “will become the standard for all the states to use.” At the moment, though, Schettler said treatment technologies “are very energy intensive, and so they’re going to be expensive.” And Seth Shonkoff, an environmental health scientist and executive director of California-based research institute PSE Healthy Energy, said, “There’s not off-the-shelf, affordable ways to monitor” all the chemicals in produced water. But Hightower said that with disposal costs rising due to increasing volumes of water and stricter regulations, “We’re at a point where this is going to be cost effective for us.” In a 2023 presentation, the cost to treat Permian produced water was $0.75 to $1.20 per barrel, while disposal costs are on track to come close to $1.20 per barrel next year, according to Hightower. The treatment process produces another challenge: “You may have cleaned up the water to a level that you’re happy with,” Schettler said, “but you have this hazardous waste left to get rid of.” That could be reinjected into disposal wells, the current protocol for produced water. But if it exceeds regulations for radioactivity, it would be considered hazardous and require more expensive disposal. Some proponents, meanwhile, say the lithium-rich waste could prove valuable. “We can use it as a source for mineral recovery,” Xu said, and the waste also contains ammonia, magnesium, and calcium, all used in agriculture and manufacturing. Kenney, the Environment Department secretary, noted that water itself is a valuable commodity, and produced water is just a “commodity in waiting.” Meanwhile, he added, evolving regulations in other states could create competition for produced water. If Texas moves to allow treated produced water reuse in agriculture or other applications, Kenney said, “New Mexico’s unusable produced water will be sold, I predict, to Texas companies.” Already, an estimated one-third of the state’s produced water is transported to Texas via trucks or pipelines for disposal because of New Mexico’s stricter permitting requirements, according to the Ground Water Protection Council. After New Mexico (along with Texas and Oklahoma) experienced an increase in earthquakes due to the injection of produced water underground, the state enacted stricter disposal regulations. Yet environmental advocates are concerned about the risk of produced water transport. According to state records of spills reported by operators, there were 938 incidents of produced water spills in 2023, with reported amounts lost in one spill reaching 4,200 barrels, or approximately 176,400 gallons. New Mexico’s second-largest petroleum-producing region, the San Juan basin, produces far less oil, but contains significant cultural resources. The basin overlaps with parts of the Navajo Nation and off-reservation Navajo trust lands. And other Indigenous groups have ancestral roots in the region, which includes Chaco Culture National Historical Park , a center of ancestral Pueblo sites. Julia Bernal, an enrolled member of Sandia Pueblo and executive director of the Pueblo Action Alliance , said the greater Chaco area is “very important to our cultural lifeways and existence.” The region is already impacted by oil and gas production, Bernal said, and produced water is being trucked to disposal sites in the area. If a new market for produced water emerges, she said, “it’s going to increase the risk of more produced water spills.” Mario Atencio, a Navajo organizer, said: “The impacts to the groundwater are just too dangerous to think about. The whole area has all these springs. In the desert, those are incredibly sacred cultural resources to Indigenous people, especially Navajo people.” Governor Lujan Grisham has vowed to return to the legislature in 2025 to seek funding for the Strategic Water Supply, and the Water Quality Control Commission will deliberate on proposed rules for produced water discharge later this year. Yet consortium scientist Xu said she and her colleagues “still have a lot of ongoing research” and need more time and funding before they determine that treated produced water is safe for reuse. For some critics, the governor’s proposal is a distraction from other conservation efforts: Bernal said it’s disingenuous for the state to claim its plan advances water conservation, when there have been “many, many years of advocacy” by local groups for “water resiliency projects that would really be about conserving water, fixing aging infrastructure,” and addressing tribal needs. Shonkoff, the environmental health scientist, frames the debate in terms of balancing risk: “One risk is being able to be resilient in the face of drought,” he said, while another is “using emerging sources of water that may present risks to humans and the environment.” And public health advocates like Schettler say the competing demands on finite water resources from the agricultural sector, growing cities, and the oil and gas industry, amplified by climate change, are only going to get worse. “There’s a tremendous need to figure out what to do,” he said. ","New Mexico is at the center of the debate because of the lucrative Permian Basin. The basin is the nation’s most productive oilfield, accounting for over 40 percent of total U.S. oil production. It also generates the most wastewater — more than 15 million barrels per day in 2022, over 10 times more than the next-highest producing basin.

667,2024-10-07 10:30:00,Grist,https://grist.org/politics/al-gore-climate-change-reflections-polarization-language/,Al Gore thought stopping climate change would be hard. But not this hard.,Climate Change,Public Health & Environment,"At a congressional hearing on the greenhouse effect in 1981, Al Gore, then a member of the House of Representatives from Tennessee, remarked that it was hard to come to terms with the fact that rising carbon dioxide emissions could radically alter our world. “Quite frankly, my first reaction to it several years ago was one of disbelief,” he said. “Since then, I have been waiting patiently for it to go away, but it has not gone away.” Gore’s hearings didn’t spark the epiphany he’d hoped among his fellow members of Congress. More than four decades later, the problem still hasn’t resonated with many of them, even as the devastating weather changes scientists warned about have become reality. Wildfires have turned towns to ash, and the rains unleashed by storms like Hurricane Helene have left even so-called climate havens like Asheville, North Carolina, in a post-apocalyptic state, with power lines tossed around like spaghetti .   “I’ll have to admit to you that I’ve been surprised at how difficult it’s been to implement the kinds of policies that will solve the climate crisis,” Gore said in an interview with Grist. So he isn’t exactly surprised that the issue is on the back burner this election season . When asked about their plans to fight climate change in the presidential debate last month , Vice President Kamala Harris assured voters she wasn’t against fracking for natural gas, while former President Donald Trump went on a tangent about domestic vehicle manufacturing. The subject took on a more prominent role in the vice presidential debate last Tuesday, when the Republican, Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, hedged by calling global warming “weird science” while not actually dismissing it, and the Democrat, Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota, envisioned America “becoming an energy superpower for the future.” And that was about it. “Since the struggle for votes is almost always focused on undecided voters, most of them in the center of the political spectrum, it’s not at all unusual to see immediate, visceral issues like jobs and the economy take the foreground,” Gore said. As told in the documentary An Inconvenient Truth , Gore’s interest in climate change was first sparked at Harvard University, where Gore took a population studies class taught by the Roger Revelle, a climate scientist who had played a pivotal role in setting up experiments to measure rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It was the 1960s, a decade in which the American public first started learning about the dangers of burning fossil fuels . Gore was stunned by the evidence Revelle presented, but “never imagined for a second that it would take over my life.” He’s spent the decades since advocating for climate action. As vice president under President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, he unsuccessfully pushed to pass the Kyoto Protocol, the first international attempt to push countries to limit their greenhouse gas emissions. Six years after he lost the presidential election to George W. Bush in 2000, An Inconvenient Truth , the documentary that turned his traveling climate change slideshow into a hit, launched the issue into the national conversation. Today, he leads the educational nonprofit The Climate Reality Project, which trains people how to mobilize their neighbors to elect climate champions, counter greenwashing, and advance green solutions. As a prominent Democrat, Gore’s impassioned advocacy has been blamed for making climate change seem like a liberal thing to care about . To Gore, that’s an example of attacking the messenger without looking at the deeper reasons why climate change is politically contentious in the first place. “Even when Pope Francis, for goodness’ sake, speaks out on it, they attack him and say that he’s meddling in partisanship.” If there’s anyone to blame for polarization, he said, it’s the fossil fuel industry, which has tried to take control of the conversation about climate change . “This is the most powerful and wealthiest business lobby in the history of the world, and they spare no effort and no expense to try to block any progress,” Gore said. “Whoever sticks his or her head up above the parapet draws fire from fossil fuel polluters, and they use their legacy networks of economic and political power to try to block any solutions of any sort that might reduce the consumption of fossil fuels.” In his decades of talking to the public about climate change, he says he’s learned a few things. You have to keep in mind a “time budget” that people will give you to speak with them, as well as a “complexity budget” so that you avoid dumping facts and numbers onto people. Finally, he says, you need to allot a “hope budget” so they don’t get too overwhelmed and depressed. Even while progress has been slower than he’d hoped, Gore sees signs that things are moving in the right direction. Last year, 86 percent of new electricity generation installed worldwide came from renewables, for example. Not to mention that Congress, where climate legislation had long gone to die, finally managed to pass a landmark climate law in 2022 , the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to drastically trim U.S. emissions through green incentives and rebates. “It’s the kind of challenge that is so compelling — once you pick it up, you can’t put it back down again — because it really requires any person of conscience, I think, to keep working on it until we get the kind of progress that’s needed.” ","Al Gore says he's been waiting patiently for climate change to go away, but it hasn't.

1179,2024-10-05 15:00:00,Grist,https://grist.org/energy/the-end-of-an-era-britains-last-coal-fired-power-plant-shuts-down/,The end of an era: Britain’s last coal-fired power plant shuts down,Fossil Fuels,Sustainability,"Britain’s only remaining coal power plant at Ratcliffe-on-Soar in Nottinghamshire generated electricity for the last time on Monday after powering the United Kingdom for 57 years. The power plant came to the end of its life in line with the government’s world-leading policy to phase out coal power which was first signaled almost a decade ago. The closure marks the end of Britain’s 142-year history of coal power use which began when the world’s first coal-fired power station, the Holborn Viaduct power station, began generating electricity in 1882. The shutdown has been hailed by green campaigners as a major achievement for the government in reducing the U.K.’s carbon emissions, providing international climate leadership, and ensuring a “ just transition ” for staff in Britain’s coal industry. On Monday, Michael Shanks, the minister for energy, said: “Today’s closure at Ratcliffe marks the end of an era and coal workers can be rightly proud of their work powering our country for over 140 years. We owe generations a debt of gratitude as a country.” The U.K. became the first country to set an end date for coal power from 2025 after putting in place increasingly stringent green regulations to reduce the running hours of its coal plants. Ministers strengthened the U.K.’s leadership on phasing out coal by calling for the deadline to come forward by a year, shortly before the U.K. hosted the U.N.’s COP26 climate talks in Glasgow in late 2021. Ratcliffe’s 170 remaining staff were invited to gather in the canteen on Monday where a livestream from the power plant’s control room showed the moment that its generating units were turned off for the last time. Peter O’Grady, Ratcliffe’s plant manager, said: “This whole year has been a series of poignant moments. I’m sure there will be a few tears as the whole thing stops and as people leave.” The coal plant once employed 3,000 engineers but its workforce has declined in line with its power output over recent years. Coal power made up 80 percent of the U.K.’s electricity in the early 1980s, and 40 percent in 2012, before petering out in the last decade due to costly carbon taxes and the rise of cheaper renewables. “This is the final chapter of a remarkably swift transition from the country that started the industrial revolution,” said Phil MacDonald, managing director of global energy think tank Ember. A report by Ember found that coal power has halved among member countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, since reaching a peak in 2007. Coal power made up 17 percent of electricity generated by OECD countries last year, according to Ember, but 27 of the 38 member states have pledged to be coal-free by the end of the decade. Ed Matthew, a director at climate crisis think tank E3G, said: “The U.K. was the first country to build a coal-fired power station. It is right that it is the first major economy to exit coal power. This is true global leadership, lighting the path for other countries to follow.” Tony Bosworth, a campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said: “The priority now is to move away from gas as well, by developing as fast as possible the U.K.’s huge homegrown renewable energy potential and delivering the economic boost that will bring. But this vital green transition must be fair, by protecting workers and benefiting communities.” Staff were first told in 2021 that the plant would close in late 2022, but Ratcliffe’s owner, the German energy company Uniper, later said it would keep the plant running during the Europe-wide gas crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine under an agreement with the government. Uniper has worked with unions to help many engineers into new jobs at the company’s other power plants or into training which could lead to work in other areas of the energy industry. More than 100 are expected to remain at the plant to carry out decommissioning work over the next two years. Michael Lewis, Uniper’s chief executive, said: “For me, Ratcliffe has always been more than just a power station — it has been a pillar of the U.K.’s energy security for decades. Built during a time when coal was the backbone of industrial progress, Ratcliffe powered over 2 million homes and businesses — equivalent to the entire East Midlands region. It played a crucial role in boosting economic growth and supporting the livelihoods of thousands of people. “This will be the first time since 1882 that coal has not powered Great Britain. As we close this chapter, we honor Ratcliffe’s legacy and the people working here, while embracing the future of cleaner and flexible energy,” he said. ",Britain's only remaining coal power plant at Ratcliffe-on-Soar in Nottinghamshire generated electricity for the last time on Monday. The power plant came to the end of its life in line with the government’s world-leading policy to phase out coal power which was first signaled almost a decade ago. The shutdown has been hailed by green campaigners as a major achievement for the government.

37,2024-10-04 22:51:09,Grist,https://grist.org/extreme-weather/fact-checking-the-wild-conspiracies-in-the-wake-of-hurricane-helene/,Fact-checking the viral conspiracies in the wake of Hurricane Helene,Crisis & Disasters,Politics & Law,"This story is part of State of Emergency , a Grist series exploring how climate disasters are impacting voting and politics. The conspiracy theories started swirling even as the floodwaters were rising: Hurricane Helene, the deadliest storm to strike the United States since Katrina in 2005, was created specifically to target Trump voters in crucial swing states. “Yes they can control the weather,” Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right representative from Georgia, posted on X on Thursday. “It’s ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can’t be done.”   Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, best known for insisting the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax, released a video on X claiming the government aimed Helene at North Carolina. Why? To force people out of the region so it could mine the state’s large reserves of lithium , a key component in the batteries that power electric vehicles and store renewable energy. The video gleaned nearly a million views in three days. Hundreds of keyboard conspiracists have taken to TikTok, X, Reddit, and other social media sites to say the Federal Emergency Management Administration is withholding critical supplies from stranded communities across the Southeast. “Just got down from the mountains delivering supplies,” someone with the username “RastaGuerilla” posted on X on September 30. “As crazy as it sounds FEMA is directly confiscating donated items and blocking volunteers from helping, kicking churches out of parking lots, etc.” The post received tens of thousands of likes, and similar messages from people claiming they were in the disaster zone have been racking up hundreds of thousands of views and reposts. There’s no saying what percentage of these bogus claims came from people actually in the areas devastated by Helene, let alone whether humans or bots spewed them. Regardless of who or what wrote them, the conspiracies are patently untrue . FEMA is not confiscating supplies. The Biden administration is not trying to kick people off of land it wants to mine for lithium. And the federal government most certainly cannot control a hurricane. To disaster researchers, the barrage of pointed conspiracies are further proof that conspiratorial thinking is becoming something of an epidemic. “We’ve moved into a space where conspiratorial thinking has become mainstream,” said Rachel Goldwasser, who tracks far-right activity and disinformation at the Southern Poverty Law Center. “Every tinfoil hat out there that says the government controls the weather now feels validated because Marjorie Taylor Greene said so, too.” Disasters invariably kick up a cloud of conspiracies aimed at casting doubt on government’s legitimacy — the dark corners of society have long typecast FEMA as a sinister, all-powerful boogeyman capable of the most outlandish and fiendish deeds. During the COVID-19 pandemic, conspiracists alleged that it was seizing medical supplies from hospitals and local governments. Similar rumors about FEMA and the Red Cross confiscating donations ricocheted around the internet after the devastating wildfire in Hawaiʻi last year. But experts told Grist that the storm’s proximity to Election Day has produced a toxic stew of conspiracies that reflect broader conversations about immigration, workplace inclusivity, and other hot-button issues that Republicans and conservative news outlets have sought to turn into cultural referendums ahead of November 5. One popular theory littering online forums alleges that the government had directed money away from FEMA to fund programs for illegal immigrants. “FEMA spending over a billion dollars on illegals while they leave Americans stranded and without help is treasonous,” Tim Burchett, a Republican representative from Tennessee, said on X, without citing evidence. Another theory says the agency had prioritized diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI, training over disaster preparedness. Immigration, and to a lesser extent DEI, are the heart of former president Donald Trump’s reelection platform. (The former president took to Truth Social on Thursday to decry the Biden administration’s response as “the worst and most incompetently managed ‘storm,’ at the federal level,” before adding, “but their management of the border is worse!”) “There was already a discourse around these issues and clearly there’s already people who are very concerned about them,” said Samantha Penta, a sociologist and expert on emergency management and homeland security at the University of Albany. “I’m not surprised that those concerns are being integrated into the discussion around Helene response.” Some of the theories reflect some tiny facet of the truth. In his video, Jones cited a real government program from the 1960s called Project Stormfury as proof that the government had purposefully “seeded” the storm. The program, which explored the possibility of diminishing a hurricane’s strength by seeding it with silver iodide, ended in 1983. Conspiracies alleging that FEMA is both absent from disaster relief efforts and confiscating supplies also contain a shred of truth based on a pervasive misconception of the role the agency plays in disaster relief. Many people believe it descends on a location with cases of water and pallets of food and armies of people with shovels and flashlights immediately after a disaster. But it is better described as a logistics coordination and check-writing organization. “You will never see someone in a FEMA jacket putting sandbags by a riverbed,” Penta said. “That is not their job.” One of its primary roles is to coordinate relief efforts and supply distribution with local and state officials and nonprofit agencies. FEMA typically discourages people from sending supplies or going into a disaster zone, not because it wants to keep aid from the people who need it, but because all those items and untrained volunteers simply get in the way and slow down relief efforts. That’s why states often echo FEMA’s calls to stay out of harm’s way and leave recovery efforts to those who know what they’re doing. “The state of North Carolina is advising everyone NOT to travel into the affected region,” the North Carolina Business Emergency Operations Center said in an email on Thursday. “We have live communications and power cables on roadways providing essential resources to affected communities that must not be disturbed. We also have roadways uncleared.” The federal Department of Transportation has placed temporary flight restrictions over parts of the Southeast to prevent amateur drone operators and others from impeding rescue efforts, providing further fodder for those who insist the federal government is conspiring to prevent Good Samaritans from helping people in need. “Do not fly your drone near or around rescue and recovery efforts for Hurricane Helene,” the agency said in a post on X on Wednesday. “Interfering with emergency response operations impacts search and rescue operations on the ground.” It is true that in the immediate aftermath of the storm, which laid waste to a wide swath of six states, many people — particularly those in remote areas or those entirely cut off by flooding — were left to fend for themselves. Joshua Hensley, an entrepreneur who lives in Asheville, has been driving across western North Carolina delivering supplies. “Most of the government involvement we’ve seen are Ospreys and helicopters flying over trying to get stuff in and trying to evacuate people,” he told Grist on Thursday via a Starlink satellite hotspot. “But as far as on the ground, I’ve been all over the place and it is almost entirely local.” In the days before federal aid arrived, restaurants, breweries, and other establishments in Asheville took to providing water, medical care, and other assistance to residents. “All the employees and community members have been volunteering their time and energy,” said Mae Walker, a serviceworker who lives in the city. “Much more than any visible assistance from police or other city officials outside of power restoration.” In the days following the storm, local pilots used the airport in Asheville as a distribution center to shuttle supplies to stranded communities and conduct search and rescue operations. But as the state and federal government’s vast disaster relief apparatus groaned into motion, their efforts became more of a hindrance than a help, and airport officials asked them to stop as the state took over such operations. The misconception that the government is not responding to a disaster, and the bogus conspiracy theories that amplify such ideas, can have dangerous implications. The Southern Policy Law Center has heard credible reports that far-right militias and white supremacist organizations are moving into the region to provide assistance — and, if past disasters are any indication, drum up sympathy for their cause . “The more people who believe that FEMA isn’t there, or that FEMA spent all its money on DEI or whatever, the more groups like militias believe they’re needed in those areas,” Goldwasser said. “They have their own agendas and goals that they’re trying to meet that supersede the needs of the people on the ground who need help.” It’s easy to see how, in the chaotic hours and days after a disaster, people might think the government has abandoned residents of the afflicted areas. But the conspiracy theories sprouting up online, and the politicians and pundits cultivating their spread, obfuscate the truth, which is that disaster relief work is messy and, yes, often flawed. “FEMA is an institution built and run by humans,” Penta said. “It’s going to make mistakes and things are going to go poorly and they will get criticism for that.” Such criticism is fair, even warranted. FEMA has been chronically underfunded for decades, a situation that will only grow worse as climate-fueled disasters become more common, more devastating, and more costly. Compounding the problem is the deepening polarization of American society, and a willingness by many people to see only the worst in the government and the people who work within it. The confluence of these two trends creates the fertile ground that allows conspiracy theories to flourish — and suggests that the flood of lies will continue to rise long after the water that inundated the Southeast recedes. This story has been updated. ","Hurricane Helene has sparked a wave of conspiracy theories on social media. Some claim the government aimed the storm at North Carolina so it could mine lithium. Others claim FEMA is withholding critical supplies from stranded communities. The claims are patently untrue, experts say, and are further proof that conspiratorial thinking is becoming something of an epidemic.

293,2024-10-04 15:00:53,Grist,https://grist.org/protest/climate-defiance-public-shaming-climate-criminals/,Can shaming the world’s worst ‘climate criminals’ save the planet?,Climate Change,Public Health & Environment,"An unfailingly friendly 30-year-old with tousled black hair and a slight, willowy frame, Michael Greenberg almost never loses his beatific smile — not even when a black SUV is plowing straight toward him . This apparent serenity makes it nearly impossible to imagine Greenberg uttering the following words, which he posted to X in May: “We are bold and brash. We get in your face and get in your space. We do not grovel. We do not make requests like Oliver Twist asking for gruel. We make life miserable for people in power. And we do not apologize. Respect us or expect us.”   As the founder of the activist group Climate Defiance, Greenberg has proven that he means what he tweets. Since the group’s founding last year, Climate Defiance activists have stormed dozens of formal events with the goal of, in their words , “ending the careers and decimating the reputations of those who disagree with us.” They’ve called Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, a “murderer” to her face, told Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia that he’s a “sick f***,” and demanded that Exxon Mobil’s CEO, Darren Woods, “eat shit.” In the last month alone, they’ve berated Occidental Petroleum’s CEO, Vicki Hollub, former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and — for the sixth and almost certainly not final time — retiring Senator Manchin. On the strength of this chaos, the group raised well over $100,000 in just one week in September. The group’s public shaming efforts have also sometimes targeted policymakers who have committed their entire political careers to fighting climate change. In the span of a few days in New York City last year, the group heckled President Joe Biden’s climate adviser, Ali Zaidi, four different times. “We confronted the National Climate Advisor with so much zeal that he fled his keynote and took refuge in a basement boiler room,” the group bragged in a recent fundraising email. Greenberg takes climate change seriously in his private life as well. He doesn’t own a car, doesn’t eat animal products (thus cutting his dietary carbon emissions by roughly 75 percent), and minimizes air travel that isn’t necessary for his work. For Greenberg and his allies, however, personal choices about how to live in harmony with climate science are beside the point. The way they see it, the rich and powerful have thrown their lot in with those who have a vested interest in continued fossil fuel use, and this cabal is the main thing standing in the way of a fossil fuel-free future — rather than the carbon-intensive proclivities of millions and millions of people like me, who don’t quite have it in them to give up cheese, let alone road trips. If plutocrats are the problem, then, it makes sense that upsetting the comfort and prestige enjoyed by these corrupted elites might be the best and perhaps only hope for getting them to change course. As Greenberg put it on a phone call with me, “We’re face to face with the people torching our planet.” His volunteers have been arrested, choked, tackled, and shoved to the ground for their trouble. “They are going after villains,” said Margaret Klein Salamon, co-founder of the Climate Emergency Fund, a philanthropic venture that is Climate Defiance’s first major funder. “They’re quite savvy on social media. And they’re pissed. They have been betrayed by the elected representatives that are supposed to be representing them.” The group represents something of a synthesis of trends that have developed in climate activism over the past decade: It combines anti-pipeline activists’ emphasis on disruptive direct action, the Sunrise Movement’s focus on expanding the terms of U.S. politics (think the Green New Deal), and Extinction Rebellion’s pursuit of virality and spectacle. The novel element that Climate Defiance adds to the mix (besides a penchant for profanity) is a reliance on public shaming, illustrated by its signature tactic of derailing formal speaking gigs. “Sunrise wasn’t shutting down speeches until we started doing it,” Greenberg told me. In the lead-up to a Climate Defiance action in May, another leader of the organization told his assembled compatriots that one of his favorite activities was shaming people in front of their family and friends. “Of course, only if they’re the worst scum of the earth,” he clarified. Climate Defiance activists are adamant that they’re not trying to change the minds of targets like Manchin, let alone those attending the events they disrupt, who are likely to respond to their stunts with awkward silence and a few jeers. Instead, the group’s public shaming is intended to galvanize the broader public to join them in righteous fury. Though Greenberg is aware of the polling that shows climate change to be a low electoral priority for Americans — a major goal of the organization is to make climate a “top three issue in American politics,” he told me — he also believes that Climate Defiance can tap into the public’s dormant anger and build a mass movement. When touting the group’s success, Greenberg is fond of pointing to social media metrics: He told me that he thinks Climate Defiance has gotten more online engagement than all other green groups combined. “Our effect is almost 100 percent through social media,” one action leader said on a recent prep call. Translating all this social media engagement into the mass mobilization that Climate Defiance envisions, however, is very much a work in progress. Turnout for individual actions has, at best, numbered in the dozens, and the rank-and-file participants I met over the past few months were typically seasoned veterans of groups like Extinction Rebellion in the New York City, Boston, and Washington, D.C., metro areas. It’s no surprise that a group this young would begin by building on a core of committed activists; what’s surprising is how much they appear to have already influenced the very elites that they harangue on a daily basis, even before it’s clear whether something as amorphous as “the public” is on their side. In December, Greenberg and another Climate Defiance campaigner were invited to the White House to discuss policy with the Biden administration’s senior climate adviser, John Podesta, who they had chased off a stage eight months earlier. “I appreciate their passion,” Podesta said diplomatically over their heckling at the time, though he later confided to Greenberg that he found the organization to be a “pain in the ass.” At the meeting, Greenberg expressed concern about a massive new natural gas export terminal in Louisiana that was up for federal approval; a month later, the administration pulled the plug on the project. Despite the lack of a clear causal connection between the two events, some observers, like Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, have credited Climate Defiance with the administration’s subsequent decision to slow-walk federal approval of all new natural gas export facilities. Though that policy change was nullified by a federal judge in July , it’s still listed as the top achievement on Climate Defiance’s website. Even so, Greenberg still sees Climate Defiance as a band of outsiders. “I don’t have 50 senators’ numbers saved in my phone,” he told me, though he allowed that he might have saved a few numbers from the so-called Squad of left-wing Democratic representatives. Even that likely undersells his access: Khanna and Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington have both shown up at Climate Defiance fundraisers, and a short list of funders includes heirs of the Disney and Getty oil fortunes, as well as Hollywood celebrities like Adam McKay and Jeremy Strong. When I met up with Greenberg after his foiled attempt to blockade the Biden campaign headquarters in July — Climate Defiance was the first major environmental group to call on Biden to drop out of the presidential race — he told me that he’d missed a call from Zaidi, Biden’s climate advisor, just the week before. Greenberg had ignored it since he didn’t recognize the number at first — and he had seemingly been too busy planning protests against Zaidi’s boss to call him back. Anyone looking to place Climate Defiance in the American activist tradition might first think of the Sunrise Movement, whose 200-person occupation of Nancy Pelosi’s congressional office in support of the Green New Deal in 2018 inspired Greenberg to engage in similar tactics. But Climate Defiance’s media-savvy theatrics hearken back to protests of the last century as well. Greenberg and Klein Salamon both speak of “making good trouble,” a nod to the late John Lewis’s quip about the Civil Rights Movement’s approach. And in targeting politicians and bureaucrats with public vitriol, the group also resembles ACT UP, the AIDS activist group known for disrupting church services, wrapping then Senator Jesse Helms’ house in a giant condom , and pelting the head of the Department of Health and Human Services, Louis W. Sullivan, with condoms during an event in 1990, shouting “shame, shame, shame” while they did so. While your mileage may vary on those comparisons, such confrontational tactics have also been the stock-in-trade of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals since its founding in 1980: “I’d rather go naked than wear fur” is probably PETA’s best-known slogan. Like Climate Defiance, many of its actions targeted public figures with surprise blitzes, as when four PETA activists stormed the runway at a Victoria’s Secret fashion show to unfurl a banner declaring Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bundchen “fur scum.” But it’s not only these headline-grabbing tactics that paved the way for what Climate Defiance is doing today — PETA founder Ingrid Newkirk once proudly declared her coterie “press sluts” — it’s also the rhetoric used to justify them. Public figures, Newkirk once said, “needed to be reminded that if they make horrible, cruel decisions, there will be unpleasant consequences.” Likewise, Klein Salamon said of Climate Defiance’s targets, “They should feel so wracked by shame that their own conscience won’t give them peace.” Greenberg told me that the most consistent compliment he’s gotten about Climate Defiance is that the group goes after the people who are guilty. Or, as a volunteer put it more bluntly in a recent action-related group chat: “Let’s keep f***ing up shit until these shitty f***ers stop destroying our futures.” How realistic, then, is the hope that the “shitty f***ers” in question will succumb to this mass shaming? Climate Defiance’s less-than-two-year record is too short to answer this question, but PETA’s half-century in the public consciousness might offer a hint. While PETA has achieved only small successes in its quest to end systemic animal cruelty, its attention-grabbing PR campaigns have caused a sea change in the way that much of the public talks and thinks about animal welfare. Indeed, PETA has become virtually synonymous with the very concept of animal rights , at least in the U.S., and if you pluck a vegan or animal rights activist out of the population at random, there is a strong chance that PETA will be a part of their conversion story. As a result of this groundswell of support, meat, egg, and dairy producers have adopted meaningful reforms to mitigate the cruelest factory farming practices. Zoom out a little, though, and PETA’s efforts begin to look paltry in comparison to the scale of the task. While roughly 1 percent of the U.S. population calls itself vegan, per capita meat consumption is at an all-time high. Factory farming not only retains its stranglehold on U.S. animal agriculture, but it has also been adopted by developing countries across the world. Every year, 80 billion-plus farm animals are slaughtered after lives of unimaginable pain and misery. Climate activists are familiar with a similar dilemma: The harder they fight, the more that the better world they’re fighting seems to recede from view. The big difference is that environmental groups like Climate Defiance have been vastly more successful at getting elected officials to pay attention. Only in animal rights activists’ wildest dreams would a presidential administration devote its biggest legislative campaign to a comprehensive law aimed at addressing their cause, as the Biden administration did in its push for the misleadingly named Inflation Reduction Act. When I spoke to Greenberg in August, he was preparing for his first meeting with a representative from Kamala Harris’ staff — his first-ever sit-down meeting with a presidential campaign. He told me his three demands for the incoming administration are asking them to stop two newly built pipelines — Line 3 and Line 5 — that transport Canadian oil through U.S. and tribal land in the Upper Midwest, and ending federal subsidies for fossil fuel production. Given the group’s apocalyptic view on the stakes of the climate crisis, those demands struck me as alarmingly modest. Even if Enbridge, the Canadian multinational behind the two pipelines, stopped all oil from flowing tomorrow, other producers — from, say, the U.S. or Saudi Arabia, which together produce a third of the world’s oil — would happily step up to fill the gap in the world oil market. Meanwhile, tax breaks and other forms of support for U.S. fossil fuel producers clock in at less than $5 billion per year. That might sound like a lot, but it’s essentially a rounding error for an industry that pulled in more than $250 billion in profits over the last three years. “At the very least we should not spend taxpayer money to subsidize a death cult,” Greenberg told me as an explanation for his focus on subsidies. When I pointed out that Line 3 was already complete and carrying oil, Greenberg admitted that getting the government to somehow dismantle the pipeline was a “long shot.” The focus on Line 3 may be motivated more by the fact that Kamala Harris’s running mate for the White House, Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota, chose not to oppose the pipeline’s construction. When I asked Greenberg what Climate Defiance had been up to in the weeks since Harris assumed the Democratic nomination in August, he pointed me to an X thread that Climate Defiance composed explaining why Walz was “a bona fide climate criminal.” To me, it seemed that Greenberg was not offering climate solutions to the next administration — he was offering climate absolution. That offer seemed implicit in the group’s tepid endorsement of Harris, which reiterated Greenberg’s criticisms of the candidate and her running mate. But having been given an ear by a potential presidential administration — after his first sit-down with the campaign, Greenberg soon secured a follow-up meeting with Harris’ top climate adviser , Ike Irby — it’s unclear if Climate Defiance can do more good outside the circle of power than it can within it. According to polling, Americans increasingly understand that humans are driving climate change, and they’re more aware than ever that a supercharged heat wave, drought, or flood might come for them soon. But they remain unwilling to sacrifice much to stop it. This impasse might place a pretty low ceiling on Climate Defiance’s attempts at mass mobilization. It’s a lesson that the group’s predecessors have learned the hard way: Peter Singer, the philosopher whose work on animal rights has provided much of the theoretical heft for PETA’s crusade, said he once thought that the unassailable logic of animal rights — that, say, if you object to someone breaking a dog’s neck for pleasure you must also object to the mass mutilation of chickens for your dinner table — would win a critical mass of converts who would stop eating pigs, chickens, and cattle, thus ending factory farming. “The idea was that once people know, they won’t participate,” he recently told Vox . “And that hasn’t quite happened.” The same story is already playing out with cutting carbon emissions. Climate change is a problem so far-reaching that it’s impossible to catalog all the responsibilities it seems to place upon those of us who cause it. Maybe we can admit that we should live more like Greenberg — that we should give up many of the foods we love, that we shouldn’t crisscross the world in airliners just to see something new. But not all emissions are frivolous. What about the 10 percent of U.S. emissions that are accounted for by health care? Or, to put things into more personal terms: No fossil fuel executive hoodwinked me into buying and burning two dozen gallons of gasoline to return home to North Carolina last week; instead, I made a choice about what was important to me and my family — a choice that involved damaging, however invisibly, a world that isn’t mine alone. Climate Defiance, and the U.S. climate movement more broadly, seem to have concluded that these questions are between individuals and their own consciences, so they focus on collective opportunities — moments when the right disruption of the status quo could bend the arc of history closer to a carbon-free future. Climate change threatens billions of living organisms across the world, human and nonhuman alike, so these opportunities are hardly ours to waste. It’s an inspiring idea, but I couldn’t help but wonder how seriously Greenberg takes it. When I asked him whether he thought future generations would look back with greater shame upon global warming or factory farming, he said he thought both would be received with equal horror. Greenberg quickly added that this sort of sober historical hindsight might not be possible, because the likeliest end result of a warming planet will be the collapse of civilization as we know it. It’s this temperature-driven apocalypse that Climate Defiance is ostensibly dedicated to stopping. But in his zeal for standing in judgment of those he’s deemed “climate criminals,” Greenberg seems to be hedging his bets — if the world ends in spite of his efforts, maybe the righteous will somehow be saved. All of us sinners, however, may well be out of luck. ","Michael Greenberg is the founder of the activist group Climate Defiance.

165,2024-10-04 21:21:09,Grist,https://grist.org/extreme-weather/hurricane-helene-flood-damage-cost-insurance/,Hurricane Helene could cost $200 billion. Nobody knows where the money will come from.,Crisis & Disasters,Politics & Law,"Even as the full scale of devastation in the mountainous regions of North Carolina and Tennessee remains unknown, it’s clear that Hurricane Helene is one of the deadliest and most destructive storms in recent U.S. history. As of Friday, the storm had caused at least 180 deaths and destroyed or damaged many thousands of homes and other buildings. In a preliminary damage estimate released on Thursday, the private forecaster AccuWeather pegged the financial cost of Hurricane Helene’s damages at $225 to $250 billion, more than double what it estimated in the first days after the storm made landfall in Florida last week — and far more than recent major hurricanes like 2012’s Sandy and 2017’s Harvey. That massive number includes the cost of rebuilding homes, businesses, roads, and infrastructure in the storm’s path from Florida to Tennessee, as well as the wages and economic output that will be lost during the yearslong rebuild.   Another fact that makes Helene’s devastation so unprecedented is that almost none of those hundreds of billions of dollars in losses will be paid out by insurance. While the storm caused most of its damage through flooding, which is covered under a government-run flood insurance program , very few residents of the southern Appalachian mountains hold flood policies — even those who live in federally designated flood zones. As of now, these storm victims in North Carolina and Tennessee have no guarantee of comprehensive public or private assistance as they try to piece their lives back together. The situation stands in stark contrast to other recent deadly storms like Hurricane Ian in 2022, where wind damage was paid out by standard homeowner’s insurance and flooding was limited to low-lying coastal areas where residents typically hold government flood insurance. “A whole bunch of these [mountain] communities don’t have access to any of these things that can help you rebuild,” said Carolyn Kousky, an expert on disaster insurance who is the vice president for economics and policy at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund. “It’s going to be really heartbreaking. It’s going to be a very long time before they can rebuild.” Helene will likely cause around $6.4 billion in insured damages, according to the catastrophe modeling firm Karen Clark & Company — a tiny figure for a direct hit from a Category 4 hurricane where winds reached 140 miles per hour. It’s barely half the total of insured damages from the 2018 wildfires in California, and only 10 percent as much as the damage from Hurricane Ian. Homeowner’s insurance premiums are rising almost everywhere in the United States as insurers deal with costly disasters, rising construction costs, and new development in vulnerable areas. They’re likely to continue to rise in states such as North Carolina, where the insurance commissioner just approved a double-digit premium rate hike. But recent disasters such as Ian and the California wildfires have also seen many insurers go bankrupt or stop selling coverage in affected states. These market collapses have forced many homeowners to go without insurance or buy it from state-backed “insurers of last resort.” Despite Helene’s historic damage, states like North Carolina and Tennessee will likely not see a similar collapse in insurance availability. “I’m not sure it’s going to have a big impact on the insurance market, because from an insurance industry perspective, this is not a very large loss,” said Karen Clark, the co-founder of Karen Clark & Company and one of the pioneers in the modeling of catastrophe risk. That’s for the simple reason that most private companies stopped offering flood coverage around a century ago, following a series of devastating floods on the Mississippi River. The federal government then stepped in to try to protect America’s many waterfront homes from flood losses. As a result, insurance companies today pay out damage claims for wildfires in California and windstorms in the Midwest, but not for major rainfall events like Hurricane Helene. The federal National Flood Insurance Program is supposed to serve as a public replacement for lost private coverage, but it isn’t working. The 5 million homes in the program tend to be very vulnerable to flooding, which has led to repeat loss events and driven the program billions of dollars into debt. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, has been trying for decades to enroll more people in the program, including those who live far from the coasts, but even its subsidized rates are out of reach for many homeowners. As a result, participation remains limited: in Asheville, the hardest-hit large city in North Carolina, fewer than 1 percent of residents have flood insurance. Even given the huge coverage gaps, Helene will still likely trigger one of the largest FEMA flood insurance payouts in recent years, perhaps to the tune of billions of dollars. But Swiss Re, the massive global reinsurance company that acts as a backstop for the national program, confirmed that most people who suffered damage during Helene won’t get anything at all. “Sadly much of the damage from these devastating floods will not be covered by insurance,” said Monica Ningen, who leads the company’s property business in the United States. She added that the lack of coverage “will make the task of rebuilding the communities impacted all the more difficult.” Without insurance, which is often the first line of defense against disaster damage, most homeowners who saw flood damage will be on their own as they rebuild. Some victims will receive a few thousand dollars from FEMA for repair costs, and some others will be able to secure low-interest rebuilding loans from the Small Business Administration. The Department of Housing and Urban Development also has a track record of spending billions of dollars on long-term recovery needs after big disasters, paying for home repairs and new housing development. But this aid money could take months or years to reach hard-hit areas, said Kousky, and it won’t come close to covering the cost of reconstruction for most people, especially those in low-income households. “These programs were intentionally designed not to replace insurance,” said Kousky. “It’s really limited.” Despite the massive amount of media attention Hurricane Helene has generated, and the historic scale of the uninsured losses, Kousky said she’s pessimistic that the storm will change much about U.S. disaster policy, whether by encouraging more people to purchase flood insurance or increasing aid for disaster victims. “There’s been so many events, they get attention and seem to be wake up calls, and our response has been insufficient every time,” she said.

","Hurricane Helene is one of the deadliest and most destructive storms in recent U.S. history. While the storm caused most of its damage through flooding, very few residents of the southern Appalachian mountains hold flood policies. As of now, these storm victims in North Carolina and Tennessee have no guarantee of comprehensive public or private assistance as they try to piece their lives back together. The situation stands in stark contrast to other recent deadly storms like Hurricane Ian, where wind damage was paid out by standard homeowner’s insurance.",http://res.cloudinary.com/drwsupfyj/image/upload/v1728700831/state-of-the-earth/news_photographs/hurricanehelenecouldcost200billionnobodyknowswherethemoneywillcomefrom.jpg

Even though many of us go into inaction during the winter, now is the time to take it up a notch and focus on our winter sustainability practices . One way we can do that is to grow some of our food indoors during the chilly months. Here are five different ways you can grow food indoors this winter. This article contains affiliate links that help fund our Recycling Directory , the most comprehensive in North America. If you have south- or west-facing windows that receive a decent amount of light, you can grow some food using natural sunlight, even during winter months. The best choices for this type of setup are root and leaf vegetables like beets, radishes, onions, carrots, and lettuce. Just make sure to take steps to prevent any water damage to your window sills. Check out the wide variety of organic seeds available to help you get started! You can purchase grow lights to give your plants additional light. With the additional light, you can grow plants like tomatoes and strawberries in addition to the plants you can grow with natural light. There are many lighting options to choose from. Among the most popular indoor grow lights for home use are fluorescent and LED lights. The more environmentally friendly LED grow lights have gained traction recently, with grow light bars , bulbs , and arrays available at competitive prices compared to older lighting systems. Many companies are coming out with small, prefabricated hydroponic systems. The AeroGarden is a popular system that allows you to grow three to seven plants, depending upon the model. If you have more space and want to scale up your indoor hydroponic garden, only your imagination can limit you when it comes to hydroponics. You can purchase a system that’s ready to go or design your own . This article from WikiHow provides step-by-step instructions for three types of hydroponics systems. Similar to hydroponics, aeroponics allows you to grow plants without soil, but rather than having the roots emerged in water, they are misted with water. Tower gardens are a popular method of growing your food indoors using aeroponics, an approach taking hold in commercial farming, too. There are many other systems on the market as well, and you can even create your own aeroponics system in a 5-gallon bucket . Many of the makers of aeroponics systems now bill themselves as “cloning systems” because the aeroponics is useful for starting plants for transplant to soil. One final option for growing food indoors is aquaponics . Unlike hydroponic and aeroponic systems, which require you to add nutrients to the water, an aquaponics system uses fish waste to fertilize your food so it’s a closed loop system. Back to the Roots offers a very basic aquaponics system for those interested in trying out this method. If you have the room, you might be interested in something like the AquaUrban System by The Aquaponics Source. It features a 2’x 3.5′ growing space and a 60-gallon tank that’s big enough to grow edible fish. However, if you’re just getting started, you may prefer to start on a smaller scale so you can get to know how it works before you invest a lot in a bigger system.

677,2024-10-10 09:05:00,Earth911,https://earth911.com/home-garden/seek-community-share-resources/,"Seek Community, Share Resources",Sustainability,Society & Culture,"When many of us think of sustainable living, we think of rural homesteads or tiny homes. Homesteads involve cultivating food and living off of the land. Tiny homes use relatively few building materials and consume less energy for heating and cooling. Yet, some people value living in large dwellings, possibly in urban areas. They prefer being surrounded by others and having large indoor spaces for entertaining and gathering. In such cases, communal or multigenerational living can be an excellent housing option that has some of the same financial and environmental advantages as a tiny home or homesteads, especially when expenses and upkeep are shared among many. Intentional communities can take many different forms and can be located in rural or urban areas. They may include a less formal arrangement of sharing a house, property, and living expenses with friends or family members. There are also housing cooperatives that can have a more structured approach and can be owned by a nonprofit organization. Coop houses may involve leases for specific rooms or units and expectations for contributing to housework and shared meals. Cohousing is a collaborative neighborhood where residents actively participate in its design and operation. This setup includes private homes, complete with a bathroom and kitchen, as well as some shared spaces in a common building, such as guest rooms and shared common spaces. Some intentional communities or ecovillages entail renting while others are largely owner-occupied. One of the great cohousing thinkers is Raines Cohen , who travels the world helping organize cohousing communities — . Some communities serve a specific population or demographic groups, such as elders , single parents, or college students. Others are multigenerational and have members from many walks of life, religions, and backgrounds. There are intentional communities located on small, urban lots, while others have many acres and are in rural areas. Many intentional communities possess a vision that unites members around a common cause or belief. The vision may encompass anything from embracing love for living things, affordability, multicultural diversity, or specific religious beliefs. These shared beliefs can unite its members and provide a greater purpose. You can create new ideas about how to organize living space and build a community. Imagine a new world and try it out. Embracing communal living does involve being aware of the needs of the whole group. In some cases, this calls for some personal sacrifice. For example, many cohousing or ecovillage communities have parking areas restricted to the periphery, and pedestrian walkways connect the houses. This might require residents to walk further when driving cars, yet it creates a neighborhood for kids and pets to roam and encourages more impromptu interactions. Using shared common spaces is a great way to conserve resources and live in smaller homes, yet it requires being mindful of cleaning up and scheduling the use of space. Living harmoniously with others requires the ability to work through interpersonal conflict. Although this can be beneficial for personal growth and communication skills, it requires work and dedication. Some communities have conflict resolution resources available, such as a trained mediator or communication classes. When members cannot resolve conflict, it can have detrimental effects and decrease trust among residents. Living in intentional communities requires cooperation and contribution. Many enjoy communities enjoy voluntarily shared meals, but somebody must coordinate, cook, and clean up afterward. Common gardens, community spaces, and shared amenities require upkeep and maintenance. Many communities expect their members to contribute a certain amount of work hours per month. Making cooperative decisions can be challenging for any organization, and intentional communities are no exception. Living collectively requires group decision making, especially when first starting and planning a community. Some groups use consensus , which requires decisions to be approved by all members. For this to be effective, members must truly listen and seek to understand one another to find common solutions. Living communally can significantly reduce our individual environmental impact by sharing resources among many people or families. For example, several households may share one electric vehicle charger or a large solar energy system . Although a big house might require more energy for heating and cooling, it isn’t that much individually when shared by numerous people. Other communities may organize to deliver healthy homemade meals to participants, which does not require colocation. Look for issues in your life that are challenging to solve — it’s likely you have neighbors who have similar problems. Many communities exist across the United States, Europe, and beyond. If you want to join one, it is important to find one that is a good fit for you and your family. A great way to get started is by visiting several communities and getting to know the members and the community vision. Do you share common core values? Does the mission statement resonate with you? It is helpful to explore how the community responds to and resolves conflict. Also, consider the expectations of members and if you fulfill them.

The SEC’s finding highlight growing efforts to hold companies accountable for overstating the sustainability of their products, sending a clear message: consumers and regulators won’t tolerate misleading greenwashing claims. The SEC found that Keurig Dr Pepper misled consumers by promoting its K-Cups as recyclable i n “ many communities” across the U.S. and Canada, even though most recycling facilities aren’t equipped to process the pods. K-Cups are a tricky mix of plastic, aluminum, and paper filters—materials that are difficult to separate and often bypassed by traditional recycling centers. While Keurig Dr Pepper has switched to using polypropylene plastic for its pods, which is recyclable in theory, the reality is that small, mixed-material items like K-Cups rarely get recycled. Municipal systems don’t have the equipment needed to handle them, so despite what the packaging said, those pods were more likely headed to landfills than being repurposed into new materials. The fine is the spearpoint of a broader push by the SEC to scrutinize companies’ environmental claims. As more environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures are made by companies, the agency will be on the watch for greenwashing. Hopefully, companies will be discouraged from exaggerated or false claims. The SEC found that Keurig Dr Pepper’s false claims misled consumers and investors by overstating the recyclability of its products. The settlement shows how serious regulators are about ensuring companies are honest when they market themselves as environmentally responsible. For anyone using K-Cups, this is a reminder that not all “recyclable” labels mean what they seem. While the plastic used in K-Cups may be recyclable under certain conditions, most recycling centers don’t handle these pods because they’re too small and hard to process. In many cases, they get sorted out as trash, especially if the pods still have coffee grounds inside. To recycle K-Cups properly, consumers must take them apart, separating the plastic, aluminum, and paper components—a time-consuming task that few people will do. If they aren’t disassembled, as Earth911 has explained , Nespresso pods must also be; the odds K-Cups will be recycled are slim to none, no matter what the label says. As part of the settlement, Keurig Dr. Pepper pledged to improve its sustainability practices and provide more accurate information about its products’ recyclability. The case also underscores a more significant issue: companies need to take more responsibility for the waste their products create. Just because something can technically be recycled doesn’t mean it will be—especially if the infrastructure isn’t there to support it. Consumers who want to reduce their environmental footprin t might switch to coffee brewing methods that generate less waste, like using reusable filters or compostable pods. Another option is finding and using take-back programs or specialized services, like Terracycle’s free and paid coffee pod recycling programs. These services can process items like K-Cups more effectively than curbside programs. The SEC’s action against Keurig Dr Pepper is a wake-up call for companies that want to appear greener than they are. As more consumers demand transparency and real environmental solutions, businesses will need to move beyond flashy marketing and focus on creating genuinely sustainable products. At the same time, consumers should stay informed, question green claims, and take steps to reduce their waste in ways that go beyond what’s printed on the packaging. Editor’s Note: An earlier version of this story indicated that Keurig Dr. Pepper was fined $15 million; the correct figure is $1.5 million.",Keurig Dr Pepper will pay a $1.5 million fine after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) determined the company made deceptive claims about the recyclability of its K-Cup coffee pods.

He founded the company in 2020 after recognizing concrete’s huge environmental price — it accounts for about 6% of annual global emissions. CaptureCrete is a powder additive for concrete mixes that extracts up to 220 pounds of carbon dioxide from the air per ton, locking it into the concrete as a stable mineral. CaptureCrete’s impact, after accounting for the CO2 it absorbs, is only about 25% of traditional concrete. But this wasn’t Tim’s first shot at carbon capture for the built environment. Previously, he developed a paint additive that absorbed CO2 and other pollutants. Carbon Limit was named GreenBiz’s Startup of the Year at Verge 2023. Building and operating homes, skyscrapers, factories, and freeways and generates about 10 gigaton of CO2, or about 40% of the emissions associated with energy use on the planet. The ability to tie carbon credits to building and infrastructure projects is key. When you can sell a carbon removal credit for around $200 a ton, the cost of a building can change rapidly. For example, if you’re building a skyscraper that’s 40 stories tall, you might need 4,000 or so cubic meters or concrete, which represents about 5700 tons of the material. With carbon credits that cost $200 per ton, that concrete represents a potential subsidy for the project of $1.1 million dollars. If we’re talking about a mile of freeway, which requires about 17,200 tons of concrete, the credits generated by CaptureCrete’s absorption of CO2 might be worth $3.4 million per mile of roadway. That’s real money, real savings that can make projects reach break-even sooner during the life of the building.

1146,2024-10-08 09:10:35,Earth911,https://earth911.com/how-and-buy/vegan-and-cruelty-free-certifications/,Understanding Vegan and Cruelty-Free Certifications,Society & Culture,Public Health & Environment,"If you are vegan, or simply concerned about animal welfare, it’s surprisingly difficult to shop your values . There are a lot of certification systems to choose from, but unlike food safety or organic products, there are no government certification systems or regulations for labeling vegan products or products that have not been tested on animals. There are not even legal definitions for marketing terms like vegan, vegan-friendly, vegetarian, and no animal ingredients. That means such terms are meaningless at best and greenwashing at worst. So if you value animal welfare , you need to know your third-party certification labels. The first thing you need to know is that vegan and cruelty-free are not the same thing . Vegan means that a product does not contain any animal-derived ingredients. Cruelty-free means that the product was not tested on animals during development. While this technically means that a vegan product could have been tested on animals and vice versa, in practice, most vegan certifications also require products to be cruelty-free, and many products labeled as cruelty-free are also vegan. You may also see products labeled “humane.” Products and foods with humane labels do include animal parts or animal-derived ingredients. Humane labels mean that animals were humanely raised before slaughter or other use. The standards of care vary widely among these certifications. The Vegan Society was founded in 1944 in Europe to promote dairy-free vegetarianism, coining the term “vegan” soon thereafter. They established the Vegan Trademark in 1990 to certify that a product is free from animal ingredients. Today, nearly 60,000 individual products, including cosmetics, clothing, food, and household items are certified. Products with the Vegan Trademark sunflower growing from a letter V do not include any ingredients derived from the animal kingdom; did not involve animal testing; and do not include any GMOs.  The American nonprofit Vegan Action (sometimes called Vegan Awareness Foundation) was established to eliminate animal suffering, reduce environmental impacts, and improve human health through a vegan diet. For more than 25 years they have certified products through the Vegan Certification program ; certified products are identified by the Certified Vegan logo with a letter V inside a heart. More than 1,000 companies have certified products that do not contain animal products or byproducts and that have not been tested on animals through this system.  The U.K.-based Vegetarian Society is an information hub for vegetarianism. In addition to their “cookery school” with online classes, the Society offers two trademarks : Vegetarian Society Approved and Vegetarian Society Approved Vegan . Vegetarian Society Approved trademark accreditation involves independent ingredient and production method checking. The trademarks can apply to foods, beverages, cosmetics, household and cleaning products, health products, pet foods, and more. Unlike many other certifications, Vegetarian Society does certify entire restaurants and pubs.  Leaping Bunny is one of the biggest and most reliable cruelty-free certification systems and is endorsed by PETA. The system is administered by multiple organizations : Leaping Bunny via CCIC (a coalition of eight national animal protection groups including the Humane Society) administers the logo in the U.S. and Canada. In the EU, Australia, and elsewhere in the world, two organizations, Cruelty Free International and Choose Cruelty Free have merged. As a result, there are multiple slightly different yet authentic logos. Unfortunately, shoppers will see a variety of rabbit-related logos that have no association with Leaping Bunny or any certification system. Consequently, Leaping Bunny requires some caution on the part of the consumer. The Leaping Bunny standard is transparently published in full on the website and applies to entire companies rather than individual products. It disallows conducting or commissioning animal testing for all ingredients in cosmetic and household products. Not all Leaping Bunny certified products will display the logo. To confirm that a product making the cruelty-free claim without the logo is actually certified, check the complete list of certified products on the Leaping Bunny website. Since 1999, the American Vegetarian Association exists primarily as a certification system to confirm that food products, skin care, vitamins, and supplements are vegetarian (may have eggs or dairy), vegan (no animal by-products), plant-based (made of a majority of plant-based ingredients), or animal-free (no animal-sourced ingredients and not tested on animals). Their logos certify individual products rather than companies.  People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is well known for its animal rights activism. Their Bunny Free app lets you search for companies by name and tells you whether they test on animals. You can request a Bunny Free cruelty-free shopping guide from their website. They also maintain multiple searchable databases of companies that do and don’t test on animals, as well as companies working for regulatory change and other animal welfare topics. Beauty Without Bunnies cruelty-free certification is available for personal care, pet care, vitamins, and household products. Companies can be certified under one of two designations: Global Animal Test-Free and Global Animal Test-Free and Vegan. The Beauty Without Bunnies cruelty-free logo of a pink-eared rabbit indicates that a company has registered as cruelty-free with PETA, but does not require as much documentation as Leaping Bunny. (An older version of the logo features heart-shaped ears.)  The PETA-Approved Vegan logo is specifically for clothing and accessories. It can apply to either the individual product or the company’s entire product line. Items with this logo do not include any materials from living or killed animals, as self-reported by the company. China’s first domestic vegan food certification, developed by the China Vegan Society in partnership with various organizations, aims to standardize vegan labeling, particularly for products that exclude animal-derived ingredients and even some traditional Chinese “pungent” plants (garlic, onions, etc.) often avoided by religious vegans. It promotes sustainable, animal-free choices across China, enhancing consumer trust and supporting a more transparent vegan food industry​  A European entrant, the V-Label is an internationally recognized certification for vegan and vegetarian products. In 2021, V-Label partnered with SGS, a global certification provider, to enhance its auditing and certification services. The V-Lable program helps manufacturers obtain that ensures that products are free from animal-derived ingredients. Originally published on December 28, 2021, this article was updated in October 2024.","If you are vegan, or simply concerned about animal welfare, it’s surprisingly difficult to shop your values. Unlike food safety or organic products, there are no government certification systems or regulations for labeling vegan products or products that have not been tested on animals. There are no legal definitions for marketing terms like vegan, vegan-friendly, vegetarian, and no animal ingredients. Most vegan certifications also require products to be cruelty-free, and many products labeled as cruelty- free are also vegan.",http://res.cloudinary.com/drwsupfyj/image/upload/v1728701414/state-of-the-earth/news_photographs/understandingveganandcrueltyfreecertifications.jpg

1402,2024-10-07 13:01:22,Earth911,https://earth911.com/business-policy/david-steinman-how-to-become-a-citizen-enforcer/,David Steinman: How to Become a Citizen Enforcer,Sustainability,Public Health & Environment,"Editor’s Note: Author David Steinman recently discussed his new book and citizen enforcement of environmental laws on Earth911’s Sustainability In Your Ear podcast. We asked him to explain how Americans can take companies and governments to court to prevent harmful chemicals from damaging nature and human health. If I were to tell you what it is I do, I would say writer, journalist, antitoxic activist, parent—and citizen enforcer. I’ve taken on some of the biggest brands and corporations in the country as a citizen enforcer and won court cases against them using available laws in both California and the District of Columbia. As I share in my new book, Raising Healthy Kids: Protecting Your Children from Hidden Chemical Toxins , I successfully sued Procter & Gamble when I discovered exorbitant amounts of the carcinogen 1,4-dioxane in their Herbal Essences and Pantene shampoos, winning a consent judgement that the court approved to reduce or eliminate the chemical. That was more than a decade ago, and I’ve been taking on big corporations ever since. After winning that case, I formed the nonprofit Chemical Toxin Working Group (CTWG) to advance my work in this unique but critical area of the law and consumer rights. Since that time, I have used the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act, which the state’s voters passed in 1986 with nearly two-thirds of the popular vote. CTWG has filed more than 200 notices of violation, a requirement of the law, before going to court or settling before litigation. The point of the law is to empower consumers. It requires that companies alert consumers when reproductive toxins or carcinogens are found in products at harmful amounts with clear label information. If I test products and find high amounts and can prove they are harmful to consumers and society, the law allows citizens to enforce its regulations. This is so empowering and places an awesome responsibility on individual citizens who use the law to do their civic duty. Most of the cases , in fact, that are brought under this California law are done by citizen enforcers. I know that I take the work seriously and bring only strong cases that we can win in the courts. But it’s vital that the law be enforced . With such information, consumers can make informed choices and use their shopping dollars to vote for the change they would like to see . The law has also made products such as Herbal Essences and Pantene safer for everyone since changes in California are often reflected nationwide. The CTWG has won cases against companies like Bumble Bee , Chicken of the Sea , Kroger , and Walmart to require prominent label disclosures of hidden chemical toxins that shoppers have a right to know about. In Washington, D.C., our group has used the Consumer Procedures Protection Act (CPPA), successfully stopping false advertising that personal-care products are free from phthalates. This victory came after our testing revealed the presence of these troubling reproductive and developmental toxins in personal-care products. The importance of citizen enforcement in our legal system cannot be overemphasized . State and federal governments are often overwhelmed by the sheer amount of illegal toxic and so short staffed that there is little or nothing they can do . At other times, public officials may even be lax in their willingness to enforce environmental laws. But we don’t need to feel helpless. I gained the courage to try to find an attorney who would do the work on contingency and help me to win in court. The first win was intoxicating. You can do this too. It takes perseverance and an attorney who knows the law in your state. I’ve seen plenty of success stories. Sharon C. Lavigne, of Rise St. James, in Cancer Alley, Louisiana, the highly industrialized corridor of the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, has used citizen enforcement laws to require that state agencies do their job and protect citizens from the proposed Formosa plastics plant planned for her parish. Michael Hickey, of Hoosick Falls, used the law to take on polluters in his his hometown for their harmful discharges of cancer-causing forever chemicals into their public water supplies. Stephanie Mero, a hairdresser in Orlando, Florida, formed a Devacurl users group on Facebook that has more than 60,000 members, many of whom reported a variety of scalp and skin injuries and fertility issues they associated with their use of the products (which contain quaternium compounds associated with infertility). Her group was instrumental in bringing together users and the success of a class-action lawsuit filed against the company. In fact, 16 states empower citizens to enforce state environmental laws. Among the most powerful laws is the Michigan Environmental Protection Act , passed in 1969, which authorizes any person to bring an action “ for the protection of the air, water, and other natural resources and the public trust in these resources from pollution, impairment, or destruction. ” South Dakota, Minnesota, and Nevada have very similar laws. Ten state residents must join as the plaintiff in Massachusetts.  The Louisiana Environmental Quality Act allows citizens to enforce nearly any aspect of state environmental law. Health and environmental regulations work better when citizens are able to enforce the law. Some 75 percent of the reported civil environmental cases are the result of citizen suits, notes Natural Resources & Environment . The average number of annual citizen actions is around 770 annually. Democracy works best when we take advantage of everybody’s unique talents and specialties to provide opportunities for them to participate in the civic life of the nation . But we need more citizen enforcers whether they are river keepers, part of the bay watch,  or simply the neighborhood toxic watch. Often, if you are unsure of how to start, you can find help from your local environmental organization. The Sierra Club , EarthJustice , and Natural Resources Defense Council are a few of the national organizations that work with local neighborhood communities on legal issues involving environmental justice. They will listen to your story. They are there to help. I reached out to an attorney who listened and believed in my first case. You can also , and find help from legal experts who share your concerns and are as vitally interested in our future as you are. David Steinman’s new book Raising Healthy Kids: Protecting Your Children from Hidden Chemical Toxins (Skyhorse Publishing, June 2024) is available from your local independent bookseller, Powell’s Books , or at Amazon.com .","David Steinman is a writer, journalist, antitoxic activist, parent and citizen enforcer.

1530,2024-10-11 15:59:24,Columbia Climate School,https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2024/10/11/mountaineering-death-and-climate-risk-in-the-patagonian-andes/,"Mountaineering, Death and Climate Risk in the Patagonian Andes",Climate Change,Society & Culture,"Mountaineers contend with the prospect of death during their climbing excursions in the Patagonian Andes, and have created a sporting culture attuned to the risks they face. Climate change, however, has begun to transform the conditions that mountaineers confront, raising questions about adaptation amidst efforts to limit injuries and fatalities. During the 19th century, mountaineering emerged as a competitive sport in Europe, but faced significant social criticisms related to its risk-taking behavior. Climbers justified their sport by highlighting its contributions to national glory, imperial competition and the advancement of scientific knowledge in geology, physiology and glaciology. Rather than accepting the argument that the sport needlessly wasted human lives, mountaineers inverted this critique by embracing the positive aspects of risking death. A willingness to risk death in the mountains potentially brought distinction for individuals, teams and countries. Patagonian mountaineering originated in the early twentieth century and was referred to as “andinismo.” The town of Bariloche in northern Patagonia was a center for Andean mountaineering culture, which revolved around exploration, establishment of routes and competition for first ascents. By the 1950s, southern Patagonia became an international destination. In addition to the Paine Massif in Chile, the Chaltén Massif—with its granite walls, alpine terrains, and proximity to the Southern Patagonian Ice Field—became a proving ground for mountaineering elites in Argentina. The Patagonian Andes witnessed growing numbers of deaths as the region was integrated into the competitive hierarchies of global mountaineering. Local andinismo clubs published records of these expeditions and tributes to the fallen. The lethality of mountaineering raises questions about cognitive biases associated with risk perception. Katherine Fox-Glassman, a lecturer in the Department of Psychology at Columbia University, remarked that these include “optimism bias,” in which we “overemphasize the chances of personally experiencing a rare good outcome,” and what is known as “affect heuristic” in which “for activities we enjoy, we tend to rate the risks as lower and the benefits as higher than they really are.” Fox-Glassman added that mountaineers may also be susceptible to the bias of “probability weighting” in which they under-weigh the chance of rare harmful events like injuries and fatalities. Mountaineering scholars have explored how climbers’ deaths—when they do occur—are made meaningful to the sporting culture. One cultural practice is to convert these deaths into what might be called “memento mori” figures. Memento mori is the Latin phrase for “remember death.” During the Middle Ages and Renaissance, memento mori figures—skulls, coffins and tombs—were used to heighten awareness of death in order to foster piety and to correct moral failings. A very different memento mori tradition has defined mountaineering. Publications by mountaineering clubs and the news media have long played a role in establishing and communicating the significance of particular climbing deaths. More recently, documentary films, corporate websites and social media platforms have become central to this process. Memento mori figures establish the cultural meaning of death. First, they provide explanatory frameworks for why certain deaths occurred, such as by rockfalls, equipment failures or unexpected storms. Second, these narratives highlight the conduct of the deceased and how they embodied the core values of the sport. Third, they provide authoritative warnings about what can go wrong during a climb. They impart knowledge that will inform how subsequent climbers approach specific routes and peaks. By making death a matter of public concern, memento mori figures promote a heightened consciousness of the risks that await climbers. This works to counterbalance the cognitive biases—identified above by Fox-Glassman—which downplay sporting risks. Climate change has affected Patagonian landscapes and ecosystems, reshaping mountaineering spaces. Indeed, as Gernot Wagner , a climate economist and affiliate of the Columbia Climate School, remarked to GlacierHub, climate change “adds uncertainty” to mountain spaces. “And while a landslide, or rockfall, might seem like a natural event, many are anything but—they are events often directly attributable to fossil fuel emissions.” Veteran mountaineers in Patagonia have identified recent environmental changes, such as the destabilization of moraine fields, the thinning and retreat of mountain glaciers and improved climbing conditions during summer months. In a 2018 publication , physicist and mountaineer Dörte Pietron highlighted how the “drier, warmer climate leads to a more unstable mountain environment, with more dangerous, difficult approaches and descents and increased rockfall.” Mountaineers have adjusted how they represent death to consider new conditions of climate risk. One recent case illustrating this is that of Corrado Pesce, who was a well-known Italian mountaineer with extensive experience in the Patagonian Andes and the Alps. With his Argentine climbing partner Tomás Aguiló, Pesce made the first ascent of a new route on Cerro Torre in the Chaltén Massif. On the descent they were struck by an avalanche. Aguiló survived the ordeal, but Pesce died on the mountain. Discussions in news media, climbing magazines and on social media established Pesce as a memento mori figure. He was remembered for his stoic resolve in the face of death, his accomplishments in mountain ranges around the world, and his nobility in demanding that Aguiló leave him on the mountain to save himself. Pesce was represented as an embodiment of the core values of the sport and celebrated as one of the best mountaineers of his generation. His death also provoked discussions about climate risk. For some, his death presented a stark warning about the perils of climbing during periods with elevated temperatures and significant avalanche potential. Pesce’s death is the most well-known within an emerging line of warning among mountaineers regarding the need to recognize and adapt to climate risk. Veteran climbers have suggested avoiding certain routes during periods of heightened instability and only climbing during periods when there is greater mountain integrity. There are also fears about growing numbers of inexperienced climbers attempting routes in the Chaltén Massif without understanding the emerging panoply of new risks. The volunteer search and rescue team has borne the brunt of the increased popularity of the zone and the accidents that have ensued in the backcountry. Mountaineering deaths have long been framed as noble sacrifices that advance the sport. Now these deaths also provide points of leverage for climbers to advance arguments about how they might adapt to the new conditions of climate risk that are reshaping not just the Andes, but also other mountain ranges around the planet. Marcos Mendoza is an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Mississippi. His research focuses on social, political, legal and environmental issues in Patagonia and Mexico. His most recent book is The Patagonian Sublime: The Green Economy and Post-Neoliberal Politics .

Deckelbaum, passed away October 2. Richard was the Robert R. Williams Professor of Nutrition in the departments of pediatrics and epidemiology and the immediate past director of the Institute of Human Nutrition at Columbia University.. He came to Columbia in 1986, and he went on to lead both the division of Pediatric Gastroenterology (1986-2003) and the Institute of Human Nutrition (1992-2020), and to found and co-direct the Children’s Cardiovascular Health Center (1987-2000). His many years of work at Columbia include successful research studying lipid disorders as well as a dedication to global health and nutrition. His pioneering work studying how omega-3 fatty acids might treat strokes and other conditions was recently highlighted in the Wall Street Journal . He was a fantastic advocate in the development of Columbia’s Climate School and the Food for Humanity Initiative . Richard was an incredible mentor to both of us. He was always available, giving us career and life guidance over the last 20 years. He shaped and helped in both of our careers. We wouldn’t be where we are if not for his unwavering and unmatched support. When we were both working at the Earth Institute, the three of us often met over what we called high tea—the “tea” being something a bit stronger—to catch up on life. He spoke softly and earnestly as he strategized about our futures and helped us navigate the sometimes-strange world of academia. Richard always had our backs. We will both miss those intimate gatherings, and his sage advice, beyond words. Richard’s international work was incredible, particularly in Kenya. He led his international work with the same empathy, understanding and kindness that guided his mentorship. He started working in international health when he was a young man as one of the flying doctors in Zambia. He never stopped engaging in international development agendas: building the capacity of researchers in Kenya; collaborating with the Turkana Basin institute ; establishing the first pediatric hospital in the West Bank and the Medical School for International Health at Ben Gurion in Tel Aviv, as just some examples. His dedication to improving global health was highlighted in the Lancet in 2008. Richard had an incredibly rich and joyful life. With his artist wife, Kaya, they had four amazing and accomplished children of whom he spoke with so much pride. He continued to travel, even up to the time of his passing, the latest being a project he was planning in Ecuador. His passion for his family, work, travel, Africa and, well, life, was infectious. He truly left his mark on all of those he touched. Everyone who met Richard said he was the nicest and kindest guy in the world. He was. And if you were lucky, he would share a glass of single malt whiskey with you and have some laughs. If one is lucky in life, you can count your mentors on one hand. For both of us, Richard was very much on that one hand. He will be missed. Jessica Fanzo is a professor of Climate at the Columbia Climate School and director of the Food for Humanity Initiative.

1914,2024-10-07 17:50:12,Columbia Climate School,https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2024/10/07/a-showcase-combining-knowledge-and-action/,A Showcase Combining Knowledge and Action,Climate Change,Sustainability,"On the heels of announcing its new MS in Climate degree program, the Columbia Climate School held its first-ever Climate School Showcase, as part of its programming for Climate Week . The purpose of the showcase was to highlight the Climate School’s mission to partner with organizations outside of Columbia to build climate solutions. The half-day event was held at the Forum, on Columbia’s Manhattanville campus, and was open to the public; the glass walls of the Forum a metaphor for visibility and inclusion. “This showcase is meant to highlight the Climate School’s cutting-edge research practice in climate science, finance and sustainability—a comprehensive approach, given [the situation’s] urgency,” Jeff Shaman, interim dean of the Columbia Climate School, told a packed house, kicking off a half days’ worth of panels and discussions. But research alone only goes so far, he said: The mission of the school—the first to be founded at Columbia University in 25 years—“is to partner with constituencies outside of the academy to develop solutions globally, and not just in the university environment,” Shaman said. The format of the showcase reflected this all-hands-on-deck approach. The panelists sat on the same level as audience members in order to foster an open dialog, and mingling was encouraged between discussions. The mood was serious and engaged, though there were frequent moments of levity. Ruth DeFries, chief academic officer at the Climate School, set the stage for the first discussion, Foundations: Climate Scholarship, Teaching and Practice. She looked at the all-female panel and quipped, “We do have amazing male scientists at the Climate School, too.” There was a visual notetaker to capture in real time all the ideas that emerged from the two panels, and to express the dynamic component of the collaborative work being done at the Climate School: an active coming together of research and action. See the timelapse videos of the notetaker’s work on foundations and actions . This panel served as an introduction to the Climate School, exploring the “foundational” knowledge underpinning scholarship at the school. Each panelist discussed their area of expertise, from seafloor mapping (Vicki Ferrini, senior research scientist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory) and Earth systems and sustainability (Mingfang Ting, professor of climate) to AI and Analytics (Kara Lamb, associate research scientist, Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering) to climate finance (Lisa Sachs, director, Center on Sustainable Investment) and environmental justice (Sheila Foster, professor of climate). Each panelist not only discussed their research but also spoke to how each contributes to our collective knowledge of how to address the climate crisis. “A university builds knowledge, and that is what we do in the Climate School,” said DeFries. “But that’s not enough. We need to meld that foundational knowledge that we’re building with the impact in the world to address this very, very big challenge that we face with climate and other issues related to sustainability,” she added. Mingfang Ting, professor of climate at the Climate School, echoed this sentiment. We need to link research to action, she said. “We need to understand how the climate system will evolve and what worst case scenarios we should expect, in order to understand how we can take actions and build infrastructure and help deal with this kind of crisis.” Sheila Foster, who trained as a lawyer and now researches how the climate crisis impacts marginalized communities, spoke directly to the issue of addressing the gap between research and action, as she has done with helping to shape New York City’s approach to equity and climate justice . “If you want to redesign a system or make it work better, I think that you can do that from within, but also from without,” she said. “Having this kind of outside role in helping institutions reshape themselves around helping to reshape the system is a really powerful reason to be in the university.” After a break, the focus shifted to the five Action Collaboratives , which pose the question, “how we can catalyze knowledge for action,” said Shaman, and aim to “accelerate impact and training the next generation of leaders to help bridge silos and make real change possible.” Sandra Goldmark, associate dean of interdisciplinary engagement, added that these interdisciplinary teams are built on “a theory of change about how we, as a university, can make real change in the world beyond the school…We want to break down not just disciplinary barriers with the Action Collaboratives, but also institutional, cultural and political ones as well: and we’re hoping you will help us do so.” The panelists each spoke to one of the five Action Collaboratives: disasters (Jeff Schlegelmilch, director, National Center for Disaster Preparedness); food (Jessica Fanzo, professor of climate and director of the Food for Humanity Initiative); water (Radley Horton, professor of climate); the built environment (Kate Orff, professor at the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation); and energy (Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law). The panel was moderated by Johanna Lovecchio, director of impact programs at the Climate School. One theme that emerged, in addition to the need for building partnerships with organizations outside of the university, was the need not only to build community around these Action Collaboratives, but also to engage directly with the communities on the front lines of climate change. “What are the communities looking for? What are the answers they need to help foster a more equitable, more holistic, more sustained resistance [to climate impacts]?” said Schlegelmilch. “There is really no perspective that is not without value.” ","The Climate School held its first-ever Climate School Showcase as part of its programming for Climate Week.

For the first time in seven years (other than brief testing periods), the waterfall sprang to life, and a stream of water sprayed over a wall of rocks before cascading into the pond below. The event was part of a project, initiated last year, that aims to use Columbia’s expertise to restore Morningside Park’s waterfall and pond, and to make New York City’s parks more resilient in the face of climate change. The project brings together faculty from Columbia’s Climate School and Engineering School with a roster of partners from other Columbia schools, as well as members of the community. It aims to address issues affecting the pond in Morningside Park, and to provide a climate resilience blueprint for public parks in New York City and worldwide. The project focuses in particular on protecting parks from the effects of torrential downpours that have become more commonplace in recent years as a result of climate change. Morningside Park’s pond was built in 1989 in a crater that was created in order to make room for a planned Columbia gymnasium, a project that was abandoned after it sparked major student protests. Though the pond has become a beloved hangout for many, its water pumps failed about seven years ago, and the pond has become a hotbed for algae blooms, which thrive in summer heat, and pose a risk to pets and children. In stagnant bodies of freshwater in New York City and beyond it, the problem of such algae is growing worse with climate change. Read the full story on Columbia News . ","Leaders from Columbia and New York City’s Department of Parks & Recreation gathered in Morningside Park on Friday to celebrate a major partnership.

These green havens play an important role in keeping our cities healthy, purifying air and water, protecting against floods and nurturing biodiversity. As urban areas grow and we witness more environmental challenges, it is vital to preserve and restore these spaces. In August, the Columbia MPA in Environmental Science and Policy ( MPA-ESP ) cohort went on a field trip to two such green spaces—Shirley Chisholm State Park (in Brooklyn) and Pelham Bay Park (in the Bronx), as part of their Urban Ecology class taught by Matthew Palmer , a senior lecturer in the department of Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology. The field trip highlights the importance and impact of ecological restoration projects that often transform a land’s value and make it a welcoming space for neighborhood recreational activities. Sitting 130 feet above sea level, Shirley Chisholm State Park in southeast Brooklyn offers incredible views of New York City, with glimpses of the Empire State Building, the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge and the New York Harbor at the Park’s highest point. The lesser-known fact, however, is that this vibrant park now buzzing with bikers and bird-watchers rests above former Pennsylvania and Fountain Avenue landfills. Explaining the restoration process, John McLaughlin, managing director of the Office of Ecosystem Services, Green Infrastructure and Research for the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, shared how 407 acres of former landfills were transformed into vibrant green spaces. The process involved sealing the landfills with an impermeable plastic cap and a below-ground barrier, while a methane gas piping system was installed to manage off-gassing. They spread over 1.2 million cubic yards of clean soil—enough to fill nearly 100,000 dump trucks—across the site, and then planted 35,000 trees, shrubs and native grasses. This new ecosystem—consisting of coastal meadows, wetlands and woodlands—not only attracts local wildlife (including falcons) but also safeguards the land by preventing erosion. Additionally, Leslie Wright, New York City regional director at New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, highlighted how the restored park plays a crucial role in fostering social connection, community engagement and biodiversity conservation. She emphasized how this transformation of a once-marginalized landscape is especially meaningful in the post-COVID era, providing a renewed space for people to reconnect with nature and each other. The latter half of the field trip took us to Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx, where restoration efforts are in full swing. Here, the focus is on battling invasive species like Japanese knotweed, mugwort and porcelain berry. A mix of mowing, herbicide application and planting fast-growing woody plants strategies are used as part of a multi-year cut-and-spray cycle aimed at bringing back native species. However, restoring forest health on these old landfill sites is tough, particularly due to the poor soil and pests like the emerald ash borer, which has devastated many ash trees. Deer add to the challenge by destroying the understory and giving invasive species an added advantage. While exclosures have been built to protect restoration areas, deer continue to be a major obstacle. The students even spotted a few of them on the trip. The decline in urban forest health doesn’t always just affect the park and the immediate neighborhood but often has ripple effects on the New York State watershed and water quality, since trees play a crucial role in filtration. Guiding all these efforts are ecological assessments conducted every 10 years, shaping reforestation, invasive species control and stormwater management strategies. Our students, inspired by the restoration efforts at Shirley Chisholm State Park and Pelham Bay Park, are dedicated to advocating for the preservation and restoration of urban green spaces. These field experiences serve as an opportunity to deepen their dedication to building sustainable, resilient communities where ecological health and human well-being go hand in hand.

2298,2024-10-02 17:54:30,Columbia Climate School,https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2024/10/02/can-we-make-food-and-fashion-more-sustainable/,Can We Make Food and Fashion More Sustainable?,Sustainability,Public Health & Environment,"At first glance, it may not seem like food and fashion have all that much in common. But these two fields, which can communicate our cultural and personal identities while bringing great joy and comfort, also represent major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, material waste and unethical labor practices around the world. By convening leaders, experts, designers and educators from both industries for a day-long discussion of wide-ranging fashion and food-systems issues as part of this year’s NYC Climate Week , the Forward Food & Fashion event aimed to address their complex challenges and brainstorm ways to ensure a more sustainable future. Presented by Clim-Eat in collaboration with Barnard College and Columbia Climate School, the day’s sessions included conversations, interactive activities, interdisciplinary presentations and even food tastings. “How can we work across sectors and break some of the silos that have built up?” asked Dhanush Dinesh, the founder of the nonprofit Clim-Eat , who hosted the event. How do we find a path forward together? In opening remarks, Jessica Fanzo , professor of climate and director of the Food for Humanity Initiative at the Columbia Climate School , said she considered Forward Food & Fashion one of the most unique events on the Climate Week schedule. “You’ve heard about the term ‘fast fashion.’ You’ve heard the term ‘fast food.’ How do we slow down these two sectors? How do we make them more sustainable?” Fanzo asked the audience. What’s more, how do we quantify the true environmental costs of these two industries, she continued. While consumer costs of, say, buying a burger or sweater may be relatively low, “Someone’s paying for the true cost to produce fashion. Someone’s paying for the true cost to produce food,” she said. “Is it the planet? Is it the people producing these foods?” In a sentiment that would be echoed by many of the day’s speakers, Fanzo said, “We have the solutions,” including better land, soil and water management; increased protection of biodiversity; and more ethical labor practices. What we need is action, scale-up and accountability—especially from the private sector, she added. Consumers also have a role to play by educating themselves, buying less or secondhand, consuming the food they do buy and demanding more transparency about where their food and fashion is coming from, Fanzo said. Sandra Goldmark , associate dean for interdisciplinary engagement at the Climate School and professor of professional practice at Barnard College, discussed working as a theater set designer in the first part of her career, until she realized how much of the scenery would be thrown into the dumpster after each show. She remembered thinking, “What am I doing? I did not get into this to make garbage.” Now, Goldmark is an advocate for circularity and fixing what’s broken instead of throwing it away. “Every single human will wake up today, will eat food and get dressed,” she said. While the presentation and price may differ tremendously, food and fashion are fundamental stories we are telling every day in terms of our histories and our cultures. How do we change our global narrative to one we won’t regret? she asked. “This is a chance to change our shared story…to reduce emissions, improve livelihoods around the world, reduce waste, raise standards of living and even sequester carbon.” Already, we are seeing our students leading the way in this movement, Goldmark said. The panel on Women Leading in Climate, featured Catherine McKenna, adjunct senior research scholar at the Climate School and chair of the U.N. High-Level Expert Group on the Net-Zero Emissions Commitments of Non-State Entities; Amanda Sturgeon, CEO of the Biomimicry Institute; Marci Zaroff, CEO/founder of Ecofashion Corp and board chair/co-founder of the Textile Exchange; Amanda Parkes, chief innovation officer of Pangaia, and Ruth DeFries, chief academic officer and co-founding dean emerita of the Climate School, shared diverse perspectives on fashion and its effects on climate—from agriculture practices to textile recycling. Although all the panelists championed the accomplishments of women leaders in the climate space, “it’s time to get men on board,” McKenna said, “and to demand governments step up.” Often “the poorest people in the world are the ones producing the food and fiber, and they can’t afford to make [sustainable] choices,” DeFries said. “And on the consumption end, most people in the world don’t have a lot of flexibility to spend extra on food and fiber.” These challenges need to be considered in a “systems” sort of way, she said; for example, what can we do to nudge the incentives system for people to make better choices for the environment? While it’s unpopular to say because it will make things more expensive, DeFries acknowledged, to change the system, we need to internalize the external costs of food and fashion—from the production to the disposal stages—that otherwise aren’t seen by today’s consumers. We will need to be bold if we want to effect real change, she said. The panelists also discussed the importance of improving traceability and transparency in the food and fashion industry, and of turning to science and nature for ideas about how to create—and destroy—materials more sustainability and regeneratively. In keeping with the event’s theme, the food served for lunch was provided by Le Botaniste , an organic, plant-based and carbon-neutral restaurant in New York, in reusable containers and dishware by Re:Dish , which had scannable QR codes to tell you how many times your container had been reused. The afternoon also offered a presidential debate in sustainability where experts in food—Ana Maria Loboguerrero, director of adaptive and equitable food systems at Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation—and fashion—Christine Goulay, founder and CEO of Sustainabelle Advisory Services—sounded off on their lessons from the field. And for the grand finale, three student teams participated in a Food and Fashion Sustainability Fusion challenge; each team created a design and a dish that embodied their vision for the future. Audience members got to taste and view these creations, including a root vegetable casserole, a tomato-liquid mocktail and a quilted zip-up tunic dyed with blueberry juice. Guest judges Erin Beatty, founder of Rentrayage; Ngozi Okaro, founder of Custom Collaborative; Indré Rockefeller, Columbia Climate School alum and founder of the Circularity Project and Michael DeMartino, executive chef of Columbia Dining, provided feedback. In the end—unlike a traditional design competition or bake-off—there was no sole winner. As Goldmark argued, a sustainable future for food and fashion depends on a diverse ecosystem of complementary solutions; “there is no single silver bullet—and either we all win, or nobody does.”","Food and fashion are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, material waste and unethical labor practices.

8520,2024-10-01 18:42:14,Columbia Climate School,https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2024/10/01/urban-ecology-in-action-field-lessons-from-randalls-island-to-bronx-park-east/,Urban Ecology in Action: Field Lessons From Randall’s Island to Bronx Park East,Urban & Infrastructure,Sustainability,"This past summer, students from Columbia’s Master of Public Administration in Environmental Science and Policy ( MPA-ESP ) program participated in an Urban Ecology field trip led by Matthew Palmer , senior lecturer in the department of Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology at Columbia. The cohort visited three key sites in New York City—Randall’s Island, River Park and Bronx Park East—each serving as a living laboratory where students explored the intersection of natural ecosystems and urban environments. Through hands-on learning and direct observation, students deepened their understanding of the vital role urban ecology plays in fostering sustainable and resilient communities. First Stop: Randall’s Island The journey began at Randall’s Island, where students met Anne Wilson, chief director of planning at Randall’s Island Park Alliance (RIPA). Wilson explained how RIPA, a nonprofit public-private partnership established in 1998, manages the park by securing both private and public funds. This approach allows RIPA to enhance the park efficiently, supporting features like waterfront pathways, courts and fields that draw nearly four million visitors annually. Next, Olivia Smith, a biologist with RIPA, discussed Little Hell Gate Salt Marsh, one of the first restored salt marshes in New York County. The marsh, named for its treacherous waters that once caused shipwrecks, supports a higher rate of plant and animal growth per square foot than even rain forests, making it a vital nursery for fish. Its tall spartina grasses filter sediments and “sweat” salt, while mussels contribute to nutrient cycling. However, the marsh’s limited space for migration and small size leave it vulnerable to frequent hurricanes, highlighting the need for additional restoration efforts. On the island, restoration primarily focuses on plant management, as animals naturally migrate to these renewed habitats. Palmer provided students with an overview of Randall’s Island’s hydrological challenges and restoration efforts. Originally two small islands surrounded by salt marshes, Randall’s Island has undergone significant changes due to urbanization, leading to altered stream flows and issues with shallow groundwater discharge. To address these, nature-based solutions like wetland construction have been implemented, which help manage stormwater and improve water quality. Most rainwater on the island is now collected in pipes designed to filter out trash and slow sediment deposition, with the island’s topography and soil microbes playing a key role in treating the stormwater. Heavy metals, while not broken down, are immobilized in the soil and absorbed by plants, while hydrocarbons are broken down by microbes. Second Stop: River Park At River Park in the Bronx, the cohort learned about the wetland restoration efforts led by the Natural Resources Group team from NYC Parks. The Bronx River, influenced by tides near its southern end, supports a dynamic ecosystem, including oysters that filter water and create habitats for marine life. However, poor water quality and excessive sediment hinder the growth of oyster reefs. The Billion Oyster Project addresses this by collecting oyster shells from restaurants and depositing them in the river to provide a hard substrate for reef formation. Students also explored the role of anadromous fish like river herring, which swim upstream to breed. A dam, initially built in the 1600s, blocked herring migration for centuries. However, the construction of a fish ladder and the introduction of herring from other locations to the Upper Bronx River have helped restore their breeding patterns. The herring imprint on the chemical composition of the river during their early life stages, which allows them to recognize and return to the same location to spawn as adults. The discussion then shifted to green infrastructure in the Bronx. Students learned how rooftops and impervious surfaces contribute to rapid water flow into sewers, leading to pollution and potential fines for New York City. The city is currently investing in green infrastructure solutions, such as green roofs, bioswales and rain gardens to help absorb stormwater, reduce sewage overflow and promote groundwater recharge. Final Stop: Bronx Park East The final stop was Bronx Park East, where Ayanna Butler, an urban ecology teaching assistant, discussed the connection between streams and forest health. She explained how hurricanes can cause significant nitrate loss from forests, impacting the nitrogen cycle—a critical process for both plant and animal life. Butler detailed the processes of mineralization, nitrification and nitrogen fixation, particularly highlighting the role of black locust trees in converting atmospheric nitrogen into a form usable by plants. In Bronx Park East, students also learned about the challenges of managing invasive species, with a focus on knotweed. Originally introduced as an ornamental plant, knotweed has become one of the most aggressive invasive species in urban environments. Its rapid growth allows it to form dense thickets that outcompete native vegetation, reducing biodiversity and threatening local wildlife. Additionally, these dense thickets can obstruct visibility, creating secluded areas that may attract undesirable activities—a concern even for law enforcement. Knotweed thrives in disturbed soils common in urban settings, making it particularly difficult to control. Its shallow root system also makes it less effective at stabilizing soil, which can exacerbate erosion in floodplain areas. However, natural shading from taller trees and plants has proven to be an effective method for suppressing its growth. By reducing the amount of sunlight that reaches the ground, native tree cover can help limit the spread of knotweed, offering a more sustainable approach to managing this persistent invader. Together, these three stops provided Columbia’s MPA-ESP students with an invaluable hands-on experience, demonstrating the complex balance needed to maintain and restore natural environments within a dynamic urban setting. From the restoration efforts on Randall’s Island’s salt marshes, to the role of oysters and green infrastructure along the Bronx River and the critical connections between forest health and urban streams in Bronx Park East, students were able to directly connect their classroom knowledge to real-world environmental challenges.

Langseth,Water & Oceans,Public Health & Environment,"A research vessel (R/V) is a specially designed ship equipped to conduct scientific research at sea. Research vessels are outfitted with laboratories, scientific equipment and technology to support a wide range of oceanographic studies, including biological, chemical, geological and physical oceanography. Marine research vessels are essential for collecting data on marine environments, conducting experiments and deploying instruments for underwater observation and sampling. Use buttons or mouse wheel to zoom, drag and drop to pan; select view below. View large version ; Langseth specs and features Named after a prominent geophysicist , the R/V Marcus G. Langseth is a research vessel operated by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. The Langseth is equipped with advanced seismic survey technology to study the Earth’s subsurface beneath the oceans, and is capable of producing high-resolution images of geological structures deep within the Earth’s crust, which are essential for understanding tectonic processes and marine geology. “Marine seismic imaging lets us peer beneath the seafloor, using technology similar to sonograms and X-rays,” says Lamont researcher and professor Suzanne M. Carbotte . “Just as medical tools are vital for diagnosing what happens inside the human body, seismic imaging is essential for understanding the processes occurring within the Earth. It functions as our ‘window’ into the Earth’s crust—the outer shell that supports and sustains all forms of life.” The Langseth is used in scientific expeditions around the world, contributing valuable data to our understanding of Earth’s dynamic processes. Humans around the world have created maps of the Earth’s surface since ancient times. But mapping the Earth deep below its surface, i.e., geophysical imaging, wasn’t possible until the development of modern seismology in the late 19 th century. Seismology is the scientific study of earthquakes and the generation and propagation of seismic waves (vibrations) through the Earth or other planetary bodies. Seismic waves travel at different speeds and paths through different materials, which reveal the existence of distinct layers. By observing how earthquake-generated seismic waves traveled through the planet, early 20 th -century scientists were able to develop a basic model of the Earth’s internal structure. As seismic techniques and technologies continued to advance, people began to use human-generated seismic waves—often from controlled explosions—to map the geology of the Earth’s crust up to a few kilometers deep. By measuring the properties of these seismic waves, such as how long it took them to return to the surface, reflection seismology could produce accurate maps of subsurface geology, and proved especially useful for locating oil and gas reservoirs. Though oceans cover more than 70% of Earth’s surface, only about 25% of the seafloor has been mapped in detail. Marine geophysical imaging allows scientists to study the geological processes that shape the ocean floor and our planet, including plate tectonics , sediment deposition and undersea volcanism . Seismic imaging, especially when combined with data from core samples and boreholes, provides a powerful tool for mapping undersea faults and improving our understanding of subduction zones . These zones, where one tectonic plate slides beneath another, are areas of high seismic activity that can produce large earthquakes and devastating tsunami. By studying the architecture and physical properties of these zones, scientists gain insight into what triggers these dramatic geohazards, enabling better assessments of their potential. Geophysical imaging is also used to study past sea-level changes by capturing detailed images of sediment layers beneath the seafloor. Analyzing the composition, structure, and layering of these sediments helps scientists understand how sea levels have fluctuated over time due to climate changes and tectonic processes, offering insights into potential future sea-level rise and its impacts. Seismic imaging is also essential for investigating the oceanic crust, which forms most of Earth’s solid surface. This crust is continuously generated at mid-ocean ridges and recycled at subduction zones—processes that drive plate tectonics and shape the Earth’s mantle and crust over geological time. Another key application of marine seismic imaging is the study of underwater volcanism. It enables scientists to map the magma “plumbing” systems beneath the seafloor, linking the characteristics of deep magma reservoirs to volcanic eruptions. Understanding these connections helps explain why some regions experience frequent volcanic activity while others remain dormant. Undersea volcanic chains are also home to hydrothermal vents, where mineral-rich fluids, heated by volcanic activity, escape from the seafloor. These vents host unique ecosystems and may hold clues to the origins of life on Earth. As on land, geophysical imaging is also vital to resource exploration at sea. Some areas of the seafloor contain commercially valuable minerals such as copper, nickel and cobalt. Though still a novel and controversial idea, deep-sea mining could one day provide raw materials for electric cars and other industrial applications. Marine seismic imaging uses seismic waves to create detailed 2D and 3D images of the subsurface geology beneath the ocean. Some studies have found that seismic surveying can potentially impact marine animals, particularly those that rely heavily on sound for communication, navigation and hunting, such as whales, dolphins and certain fish species. To minimize marine-life disturbance, each seismic project conducted by the Langseth undergoes an extensive review process, and Lamont must submit environmental assessments to NOAA National Marine Fisheries Services for evaluation of the project’s potential environmental impacts. Once a project has been approved, the Langseth typically employs five qualified protected species observers (PSOs) on every seismic expedition it undertakes. PSOs actively monitor the survey area both visually and acoustically, and the seismic source is shut down if it is determined that a marine mammal is located within a predefined and permitted perimeter of the vessel. A “soft start” technique may also be used to gradually increase noise levels, allowing animals time to move away from the sound source, and surveys can be timed to avoid sensitive periods for marine animals (e.g., breeding or migration seasons). Such efforts aim to protect marine life while balancing the need for valuable geological data. The impact of seismic surveys on marine animals remains an active area of research, with both scientists and environmentalists advocating for more in-depth studies. Learn More ","The R/V Marcus G.

8776,2024-09-24 21:13:57,Columbia Climate School,https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2024/09/24/unlocking-the-potential-of-universities-to-end-hunger-and-malnutrition/,Bollinger Convening: Unlocking the Potential of Universities to End Hunger and Malnutrition,Agriculture & Food,Sustainability,"Can knowledge institutions like universities address seemingly intractable issues like global hunger? How can they get critical research into the hands of policymakers? And how can universities co-create solutions with communities that are the most impacted by climate change and food insecurity? These questions were front and center on September 21 at Food for Humanity: Unlocking the Potential of Universities to End Hunger and Malnutrition, hosted by Jessica Fanzo, professor of climate at the Climate School and director of the Food for Humanity Initiative; and Glenn Denning, professor of professional practice in the School of International and Public Affairs and director of the Master of Public Administration in Development Practice. It was the first of Columbia Climate School’s events as part of New York City’s Climate Week, and the first of Columbia’s Bollinger Convenings —a series that showcases innovative work from Columbia that advances human welfare and benefits society, named after former Columbia University president Lee Bollinger. It was also the launch of the Food for Humanity initiative, which supports fresh approaches to interdisciplinary research and educational offerings on healthy and sustainable food systems. The event opened with the year’s first World Leaders Forum. Columbia interim president Katrina Armstrong welcomed the visitors and stressed the importance and timeliness of actions to end hunger and malnutrition. Denning moderated a lively discussion on challenges and solutions for achieving food security with Lazarus Chakwera, president of Malawi; Garry Conille, prime minister of Haiti; and Ambassador Ertharin Cousin, CEO and founder, Food Systems for the Future, and a second discussion included Rosângela da Silva, first lady of Brazil; Angela Olinto, provost of Columbia University; and Thomas J. Trebat, director of the Rio Global Center. The world leaders shared the complexities—and differences—of the food security challenges faced by their respective countries. “Climate change is an enemy of food production,” Chakwera said, continuing that countries like Malawi need to move beyond subsistence farming to ensure long-term food security. Chakwera also discussed the role that universities have in research and innovation regarding agriculture and climate resilience. “Universities are indispensable to this equation, because these policies cannot be implemented to the standard and the speed that we require without their involvement,” he said. The World Leaders Forum was followed by a set of panels exploring the role of research, universities, and partnerships in addressing hunger, food security and food systems transformation. Fanzo opened the conference, laying out the urgent stakes at hand. With global conflict, climate extremes and COVID-19 disrupting food production and supply chains, “The world faces a hunger crisis of unprecedented proportions ….Diets are contributing to this burden and the global food system is not delivering on its most fundamental mission: to provide adequate, nutritious food for everyone at all times,” she said. Yet, Fanzo added, there are unique opportunities for collaboration: “This convening aims to bring together leading universities, research institutions, and key international and national organizations with a goal to identify new mechanisms for partnership and resource mobilization that will drive the positive transformation of our global food systems.” Denning agreed with that sentiment. “Out of adversity can come opportunity,” he said, especially with universities playing a role in transforming food systems. Wafaa el-Sadr, from Columbia University’s Columbia Global program, moderated the first session, which included representatives from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, UN Women and the International Food and Policy Research Institute. Purnima Menon, senior director, International Food Policy Research Institute, opened the session, highlighting the critical role researchers can play in connecting the dots between data, evidence and policy. She pointed out that researchers must align their research and interests with policy needs as well as be proactive in policy circles. Other speakers noted the importance of communicating research as well. Ana Maria Loboguerrero, director, adaptive and equitable food systems at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, stated: “There is a call for universities and research institutions to fill the gap in food data. But the issue is so complex. We can’t stop there. We must fill information gaps and also package this data to persuade. You can’t persuade policy makers by making a graph.” Another panel, comprised of people representing the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the University of Chicago, the State Department, Clim-Eat and Columbia University, highlighted the role of partnerships between universities and others. Cary Fowler, special envoy for Global Food Security, the U.S. Department of State, and Cynthia Rosenzweig, senior research scientist at the Climate School, spoke about their partnership in the Vision for Adapted Crops and Soils (VACS), a large project with a range of partners. The State Department leads the project, and Fowler discussed how his office had a convening role regarding what they saw as the priorities, while the university piece led by Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP), under the direction of AgMIP co-founder Rosenzweig, helped develop the evidence around climate impacts. This was just one example illustrating how different types of institutions in a partnership can have distinct roles. Finally, at the convening, students from Columbia University and beyond also presented their research in agriculture and food systems projects, illustrating that students can both play an integral part in the activities, but their participation can also be transformative for their own role as future leaders in this space. Michael Sheldrick, a co-founder of Global Citizen, likewise discussed the dynamic role that student movements can have in pushing forward the development agenda. Rehman Hassan, an Act4Food youth leader and human rights advocate, stated, “We must focus on intersectoral action, and youth must be involved. Because we are the people who are going to be living in the world we create.” The Bollinger Convening was an important moment to showcase the global research and policy collaborations that SIPA, Columbia’s Climate School and the wider Food for Humanity Initiative curate. As Fanzo said, “It is an opportune moment to bring distinct and diverse communities together to ensure that university research remains relevant to real-world food policy challenges and that research addresses the most pressing need to improve food security for everyone, everywhere.” ","Food for Humanity: Unlocking the Potential of Universities to End Hunger and Malnutrition was held on September 21.

Milton made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane on Wednesday night near Sarasota County’s Siesta Key , spawning dozens of tornadoes, 28ft waves, strong winds, heavy rainfall, and devastating storm surge . Six people in St Lucie County retirement village have been killed by tornadoes brought on by the hurricane after a dozen twisters spawned in the region within 20 minutes. About 2.5m homes and businesses in Florida have been left powerless, with those in the west-central region the worst impacted. More than 50,000 linemen have been deployed in an effort to restore power, Governor Ron DeSantis announced on Thursday.

Hundreds of people were rescued Thursday in the aftermath of the storm, which brought historic rainfall in Tampa, flung debris and trees around streets, and left the Tampa Bay Rays’ St Petersburg field in shambles. Amid evacuation alerts for millions, experts had warned that this could be one of the deadliest and most destructive storms in recent years, just as residents started to pick up the pieces from last month’s Hurricane Helene. With the toll of its destruction still in limbo, how does Milton compare to the most fatal hurricanes in the 21st century? Hurricane Milton first made landfall on Wednesday night near western Florida’s Siesta Key, with maximum sustained winds of 120mph. The hurricane has triggered dozens of tornadoes, heavy rainfall and 28ft waves in the Gulf Coast. Though Milton strengthened into a Category 5 over the Gulf of Mexico, it weakened before making landfall. Florida is no stranger to hurricanes, with Category 4 Helene wreaking havoc just a few weeks earlier. In fact, of the seven deadliest hurricanes since the year 2000, four have had major impacts in Florida, as shown on the map above. Those four are in addition to Helene. All of the most fatal hurricanes have come in from the Atlantic, gaining speed, size, and pressure in the Gulf of Mexico as they enter its warm waters. By late Thursday, the death toll of Hurricane Milton stood at 14 people, though the situation was developing rapidly. Search and rescue operations were still underway in the state on Thursday night. This century’s deadliest hurricane to date remains Katrina in 2005, which killed 1,392 people. The vast majority of those deaths were confirmed in Louisiana, with many in the city of New Orleans. Yet the recent Hurricane Helene is close behind, with a death toll of more than 228, and possibly more as hundreds remain missing . The most impacted states were the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida, and Tennessee. Hurricanes can cause billions of dollars worth of damage in a matter of hours and days. Since the year 2000, the seven most fatal hurricanes alone have caused over half a trillion dollars worth of damage ($570 million+), without even counting the dozens more which have hit land. Hurricane Ian in 2022 was the most expensive hurricane in recent history, causing $133 billion of damage across Florida and the Carolinas in particular. As it has been less than 24 hours since Milton’s landfall, its impact cannot yet be measured; but Hurricane Helene is already estimated to have caused at least $30 billion and as much as $47 billion and counting in flood and wind losses, most of which were uninsured. AccuWeather said Thursday that preliminary estimates of damage and economic loss are between $160 billion and $180 billion. As Florida is so exposed to hurricanes and consequential damage, there have been concerns over the viability of insurance for local homes and businesses going forward. Power outages from Hurricane Milton hit a peak of 3.4 million customers , according to tracker PowerOutage.US, with dozens of counties in Florida losing power in the past day. As of mid-Thursday afternoon, over three quarters of customers in Hillsborough and Pinellas Counties – around the Tampa area – had reported power outages, according to tracker FindEnergy. This amounts to hundreds of thousands of homes. The map below shows that the power outages are concentrated in central and western Florida, in the hurricane’s path. This puts Milton high on the list of hurricanes which have impacted electricity supplies and infrastructure. Hurricane Irma in 2017, which peaked at sustained winds of 132 mph, led to power outages for over 6.7 million customers in at least six states. Meanwhile other hurricanes like Ida, in 2021, may have been stronger and caused more financial damage, but had less impact on power supplies. On Thursday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis warned residents that they could see more hurricane activity in the coming months. The Atlantic hurricane season runs through the end of November. While storms decline in October, it is the third-most-active month of the season for tropical activity in the Atlantic Basin, according to FOX Weather. Hurricanes need two ingredients to form: warm water and winds. They start in tropical regions, where the ocean is at least 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The hot ocean water evaporates, creating warm moist air. Winds also lead to even more evaporation. The moist air rises high into the planet’s atmosphere, where it begins to cool. Then, the water vapor condenses back into water droplets. The droplets form storm clouds. As warm air continues to rise from the ocean, the winds blow in the circular motion around the center, and gather thunderstorm clouds. Once those winds reach a maximums sustained wind speed of 74mph, the cyclone is officially a hurricane. The Gulf of Mexico has seen record warm ocean temperatures over the last few months. These conditions add gasoline to a hurricane, fueling the rapid intensifcation seen with Milton. Hurricane Milton was the Gulf’s strongest late-season storm on record, and the strongest hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico since Hurricane Rita in 2005. Climate change, which has spurred marine heat waves across the majority of the world, ensures hurricanes bring more intense rainfall and increased storm surge from rising seas.","Hurricane Milton made landfall on Wednesday night near western Florida’s Siesta Key, with maximum sustained winds of 120mph.

John Santos, of Palm Beach , bought the luxury vehicle in January of this year and carefully covered every inch of it this week, as Milton barrelled towards the Sunshine State on Wednesday. A video of the preparations, posted to TikTok , has amassed over 63 million views. In it, Santos is seen meticulously covering his new Chevrolet Corvette in layers of what appears to be industrial quality plastic and film. Some social media users were supportive, with one writing: “I wish you THE BEST. I think this is honestly smart.” Others questioned why Santos simply did not get in the car and escape. “Babe, take your corvette and run in another state,” another said, adding: “Literally u have a corvette just use it to drive away like I’m so confused.” Santos posted a follow-up clip in which he explained his decision not to evacuate from his home, which is nine miles from the water, but was not expected to bear the brunt of the storm. “It doesn’t make sense,” he said. “If we go north we’re probably not going to make it that far and we could end up in a worse situation.” Despite making landfall as a Category 3 hurricane on Wednesday night near Sarasota County’s Siesta Key, Milton lost strength as it crossed land, dropping to a Category 1 hurricane with top sustained winds of 85 mph as it reached the peninsula's east coast. By Thursday morning, the storm was moving away from Florida’s Atlantic coast after lashing communities on the eastern shoreline. The decision to wrap up the Corvette was inspired, Santos explained, by a Porsche in Tampa that survived Hurricane Helene by being wrapped in plastic. “In terms of floating away we’re not really worried about that,” Santos said in his video. “It’s going to be in a garage with two feet of water — max, we’re only dealing with rainwater not a storm surge.” He added: “We also have ventilation at the top so as it fills up with water, the air is just going to be displaced out of the top of the plastic.” Though he promised an update on the vehicle, Santos told The Independent that he “did not see a drop of rain” overnight on Wednesday. “I’m planning on unwrapping that car later today and taking it for a drive,” he said. Santos is one of the lucky ones, after millions were forced to evacuate from areas on Florida’s west coast, including Tampa Bay and Sarasota County. At least nine people have died and more than 3.3 million homes and businesses in Florida have been left powerless. The hurricane brought multiple tornadoes — which spawned within roughly 20 minutes — 28-foot waves, strong winds, heavy rainfall, and devastating storm surge.","John Santos, of Palm Beach, Florida, bought the car in January of this year.

9288,2024-10-09 23:00:00,Greenpeace,https://www.greenpeace.org/canada/en/press-release/67541/climate-experts-react-to-deputy-prime-minister-chrystia-freelands-sustainable-finance-announcement/,Climate experts react to Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland’s sustainable finance announcement,Sustainability,Climate Change,"TORONTO – Thousands of sustainable finance experts from around the world gathered in Toronto this week for the PRI in Person conference, offering the Canadian federal government an important opportunity to deliver details on Canada’s approach to sustainable finance. New financial rules are desperately needed, as Canada is already listed by the UN as a “low regulation jurisdiction” on sustainable finance, while being home to financial institutions who have the highest levels of financing for oil, gas, and coal. In a speech at the conference, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland noted they are continuing to advance reporting requirements and sustainable finance labeling, known as a taxonomy; but they must advance policy that truly aligns our financial system with Canada’s climate commitments. The government’s directive that a taxonomy must be scientifically aligned with 1.5-degrees is positive, which means that a sustainable finance taxonomy must not, by definition, include oil or gas. While excluding new fossil fuel expansion from the sustainability label is obvious, including existing ‘natural’ methane gas projects in the taxonomy in any way would be problematic, given that studies show that gas – when accounting for its extraction, cooling, and transport – is more polluting for the climate than coal. The government must deliver on promises of prominent representation for civil society climate experts as well as Indigenous rights holders, as the initial process three-years ago missed these essential perspectives. Yet, more progress for truly climate-aligned finance, including requirements for 1.5-degree aligned climate transition plans, must be prioritized. Finance is the missing piece of Canada’s federal climate plan, and new policy is needed to ensure our financial system aligns with the goals of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Julie Segal, Senior Program Manager of Climate Finance, of Environmental Defence Canada, said: “These sustainable finance policies should be the foundation for our financial system to align with climate action. The definition of what constitutes a sustainable investment should be water-tight to ensure it does not promote greenwashing, and has to be driven by science, not politics. The government’s acknowledgement that new oil or gas projects are inconsistent with a safe climate is a positive step, but investments in any type of gas projects still risk locking Canada into an anachronistic economy. The announcements from the government today on a taxonomy and disclosure requirements for large companies are sensible, but further requirements to align our financial system with climate action are needed to establish credibility and move our financial system in the right direction, including through requiring Credible Climate Transition Plans across the economy.” Richard Brooks, Climate Finance Director with Stand.earth said: “It’s clear from a report from the University of Toronto published yesterday that Canada’s biggest financial institutions are not doing enough to accelerate the energy transition. They are doing the exact opposite with financed emissions double the total emissions of Canada. This is why we need more robust financial regulation to drive substantial climate action by big banks and pensions. Today’s announcements on taxonomy and disclosure help but our government must go much, much further to flip our financial institutions from making the climate crisis worse to advancing real climate solutions.” Karine Peloffy, Lawyer & Sustainable Finance Project Lead at Ecojustice and CAFA’s legal architect said : “This taxonomy announcement was meant to settle what does and doesn’t count as a ‘sustainable investment’ — an ingredient in a broader effort to align Canada’s financial sector with Canada’s climate commitments, and ensure one isn’t working actively against the other. Instead, what we got was yet another “plan to eventually make a plan” that leaves the door open to considering fracked fossil gas as a climate solution, and brings us no closer to reining in the climate-heating investment practices of the financial sector. If decision-makers are looking for inspiration to bring much-needed clarity to this sector, I’d strongly recommend they borrow from the common-sense principles found in the proposed Climate-Aligned Finance Act (CAFA) , currently before the Senate.” Adam Scott, Executive Director, Shift: Action for Pension Wealth & Planet Health said: “Aligning Canada’s financial system with climate goals is essential to protecting our financial system and our planet. Any policies to get us there must be fit for purpose. The task of completing a climate transition is not about short-term marginal emissions reduction. It’s about creating a systemic pathway for fully replacing fossil fuels in our energy system. Policies like Canada’s new climate taxonomy must get this right in order to avoid stranded assets and climate failure. Keith Stewart, senior energy strategist with Greenpeace Canada said: “Taxonomies and disclosures are nice, but what we really need is for our elected officials to step up and set clear rules to move big money out of fossil fuels and into climate solutions. Anything less is an insult to everyone picking up the wreckage of their lives after unnatural disasters like wildfires, floods and storms supercharged by the burning of fossil fuels.” ENDS For Media Inquiries Laura Bergamo, Communications Campaigner, Greenpeace Canada [email protected] ; +1 438 928-5237 Alex Ross, Communications Manager, Environmental Defence [email protected] ; +1 647 546-3230 Cari Siebrits, Communications Strategist, Ecojustice [email protected] ; +1 647 620-1212","Thousands of sustainable finance experts from around the world gathered in Toronto this week for the PRI in Person conference.

Committing to the principles of this Consensus is an opportunity for the federal parties to ensure the credibility of the environmental component of their future election platforms in the eyes of Quebec voters,” said the coalition members. The Vire au vert coalition has sent letters to the different federal parties, calling on them to take a position on the Quebec Environmental Consensus, and is awaiting a response. Quebec’s environmental ambition is non-negotiable “Throughout its history, Quebec has incorporated strong, structuring environmental principles that have guided its economic and social development. The choice of hydroelectricity and the nationalization of its production and distribution, the adoption of a zero-emission vehicle standard, the implementation of a carbon market that puts a price on pollution and caps emissions – these are all choices made by Quebecers, that have been brought together in a set of plans, strategies, laws and regulations. They make up a foundation on which our future will continue to be built,” added the members of the group. “The Quebec Environmental Consensus is the baseline on environmental issues that must be respected by the federal parties if they want the Quebec electorate to take them seriously. There’s nothing radical about what’s in the Consensus – the policies and principles are basic common sense,” said the members of the coalition. The Vire au vert coalition has prepared a summary of the key elements of the Consensus and has invited the federal political parties to refer to it as they prepare for the next election, to ensure that their proposals respect Quebec’s environmental orientations.

So what’s Lush Cosmetics got to do with it? And why does it matter? There has never been a more crucial time to fight plastic pollution as we are rapidly approaching INC-5, the last scheduled negotiation session for the Global Plastics Treaty, in Busan, South Korea this November. If countries can secure a strong treaty that caps plastic production and directs a clear pathway to a reuse-based society, the world has a real chance to solve the plastic pollution crisis. This is our once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to address plastic pollution at the source and bring about long lasting systemic solutions that put people and the planet first. Whether we like it or not, businesses are at the forefront of plastic pollution – not only as the main producers and users of single-use plastic, but also as innovators and adopters of alternatives and solutions. Many companies already know that ditching plastics isn’t just good for the environment, it’s good for business, too! In fact, research has found that zero waste approaches create over 200 times more jobs than disposal-based systems that primarily burn or bury waste. There is no better time for forward-thinking businesses around the world to send a strong message to their national governments that they support the creation of a truly ambitious, legally binding Global Plastics Treaty that seeks to reduce plastic production and end pollution across the full lifecycle of plastics. Science tells us this is essential if we are to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and protect biodiversity . As part of our global campaign to end the plastic crisis, Greenpeace International has joined forces with Break Free From Plastic and Plastic Pollution Coalition to launch Champions of Change . This global initiative is a platform for companies to leverage their influence with one common demand for the world’s governments to negotiate an ambitious Global Plastic Treaty that will drastically cut plastic production for good. By bringing together reuse and refill shops, low-plastic and plastic-free brands, and companies actively working to operate without contributing to the plastic crisis, our aim is to demonstrate that ending the age of plastic doesn’t conflict with a healthy business landscape. So wait, what about the bath bombs? Lush Cosmetics , proud inventor of the beloved bath bomb, was one of the first companies to sign our open letter and become a Champion of Change! In case you haven’t heard, Lush is well known for being a global leader in naked personal care products – products like solid shampoo, soap, and lotion bars sold without packaging. In fact, about half of their products can be taken home with no packaging. Lush notes that it has managed to divert nearly 6 million plastic bottles globally from landfill by selling shampoo bars alone. Now that’s something worth celebrating with a lush-ious bath bomb filled bubble bath! Lush is determined to continue reducing plastic from their business operations, acknowledging that they currently continue to rely on plastic. In a demonstration of this commitment, Lush is going big on October 4 with a Day of Action in support of an ambitious Global Plastics Treaty in all 260+ of their stores across the US and Canada! On this day, Lush stores will undergo a makeover as their window screens highlight the Global Plastics Treaty and staff will invite shoppers to take action by contacting their heads of state. Come in to buy soap, leave a plastic pollution advocate – we love to see it! And with Lush being just one of almost 250 Champions of Change from around the world, can you imagine the impact we could make together if more companies got onboard and organized similar initiatives? Make no mistake, there is no business on a dead planet. The world is moving forward and more and more businesses like Lush and other Champions of Change are stepping up by using their power to amplify the demands of the people. With less than two months to go until INC-5, there is still time for more companies to take action and join the call to cut plastic production and end single-use plastics for our health, our communities, our climate and our planet. Companies, we invite you to join fellow business leaders for a strong Global Plastics Treaty by becoming a Champion of Change and signing the open letter ! Not a business? Not a problem! We welcome and encourage individual supporters to sign our petition to show your support for an ambitious Global Plastics Treaty that will drastically cut plastic production. We couldn’t have made it this far without you. Let’s keep going together until we win!","A Global Plastics Treaty is being negotiated right now at the United Nations.

This month, we’re thrilled to shine a light on one of Greenpeace Canada’s Photo Contest winners, Jack Adamson, whose image captured not only the beauty of nature but also the essence of a deeply personal story and a beautiful poem. When Jack submitted their photo, we were immediately captivated by its vivid colors, emotional depth, and stunning composition. But what made this entry truly remarkable was its story—a tale of connection, reflection, and the power of nature to inspire and heal. Here’s the story behind the photo (in the words of the photographer): This is Staqeya, the Lone Wolf of Discovery Island, carved by good friend and artist Kent Laforme. Sacred to the local indigenous tribes, Staqeya was tragically shot and killed by a hunter not long after he swam back to the mainland. The void in this sculpture points directly toward Discovery Island where the Lone Wolf once roamed, and for me, represents the bullet that ultimately killed the wolf. I photographed this sculpture that stands at Cattle Point the morning of its unveiling, and as luck would have it, the sun peered directly through the void that very morning, which happens only twice a year. It was captured through 3 exposures, and manually blended together to accentuate the magnificent lighting that magical morning. I share the following poem about Staqeya written by my mother-in-law. STAQEYA FROM TL’CHES, STILL WITH US, RELEASED FROM STONE By Linda Rogers, former Poet Laureate of Victoria There is a woman who lives alone in the forest and bathes at night, when Moon rises over the ocean, where every evening Staqeya, the lone wolf, mindful eater of fish brains, stalks her, following her from island to island, his soul transformed by desire for the sister who is born knowing Mother Star is the portal inviting us home.  She has caught many rides on Staqeya’s back, his mighty lungs blowing open doors in the sky every time the little suns come out to dance.  It is hubris to murder the living incarnation of spirit, but soul survives, swims through every element: fire, air, water, until it feels the Earth move again.  Every wild woman who sings to the rivers, every sculptor who carves stone, and every photographer knows that marble is rock enduring, and wolves who howl at night are immortals released through portals where animus waits to emerge from apertures of light. We hope you enjoyed learning the story behind this stunning winning photo and loved it as much as we did. Stay tuned for more inspiring stories from our amazing supporters!","Jack Adamson's photo captured the essence of a deeply personal story and a beautiful poem.

We’ve just returned from another marine investigation, this time on the high seas of the North Pacific Ocean. From aboard our Greenpeace ship, Rainbow Warrior , we concluded a five-week expedition documenting the destructive fishing practices around the Emperor Seamount . We also exposed the labor conditions on Taiwanese longlining vessels — the most prevalent fleet that fish these waters. A vast chain of underwater mountains , the Emperor Seamounts are surrounded by water columns which are enjoyed by tuna, along with blue, sperm and humpback whales . The seabed below is home to a variety of coral and sponges , and various seabirds — like the ancient Albatross — fill the skies above. “The Emperor Seamounts are a remarkable biological hotspot, teeming with life,” explains Helena Pirhonen, Fundraising Lead on the Greenpeace International Oceans are Life campaign. “Unfortunately, this is exactly why they have been targeted heavily by industrial fishing. They need to be protected to allow life there to recover.” This area should be a top priority for ocean protection under the new Global Ocean Treaty, because it’s threatened by illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. To help make our case for its protection, we monitored and interacted with nine fishing vessels from a safe distance, and documented their longline hauls. Longlines are 100km long fishing lines attached to floats which are dragged behind fishing vessels. These longlines lead to significant “bycatch” — ensnaring turtles, seabirds, and sharks in their wake. Over 25 hours, we recorded 84 sharks being hauled from the ocean from these longlines — that’s a rate of three sharks per hour. The sharks were either dead or killed thereafter, with no regard for their age or endangered status. As my colleague Vela Andapita described it, these catches were “more shark than tuna.” One haul we recorded saw countless (well, we counted them: over 935) empty hooks, one young tuna fish, and 16 sharks. These numbers reflect the emptying of our oceans from overfishing, despite what big business may claim about healthy tuna stocks in the Pacific. But harmful fishing practices don’t just take place in the water. Fishers aboard these vessels are often stranded at sea for months or even years at a time, working in difficult, sometimes severe, conditions — and cut off from their friends and family at home on land. Over the last few years, we’ve collaborated with the Indonesian Migrant Workers Union (SBMI) — which frequently receives complaints from Indonesian migrant fishers — to investigate the forced labour and illegal fishing practices on distant-water fishing vessels. So, with permission from the ship’s captains, we approached the Taiwanese longliners from our inflatable dinghies and offered the fishers packages of coffee, soap, Indonesian noodles , and more. We also shared our Wi-Fi from the Rainbow Warrio r, so they could contact their loved ones at home. Once the Wi-Fi was up, almost all the fishers grabbed their phones to call home for the first time since they left land two to three months prior. © Myrthe Verweij / Greenpeace. Crew onboard the Rainbow Warrior in the North Pacific Ocean, display a net banner reading “FREE WIFI”. The wifi will be offered to fishers onboard longline fishing vessels. Along with urging governments to ratify the Global Ocean Treaty by 2025 , and specifically protect these seamounts, we’ll continue to advocate for the rights of fishers at sea . Because these destructive practices do not just exploit marine ecosystems, they harm people as well. If you’d like to learn more about this investigation follow this link .

The poll also found that Canadians were less trusting of oil companies after the companies deleted environmental claims from their websites and social media once the law came into effect. The polling data was included in Greenpeace’s submission to the federal Competition Bureau’s consultation on how they will apply the law. “Canadians want strong rules to prevent greenwashing and don’t trust oil companies to tell the truth without them,” said Greenpeace Canada senior energy strategist Keith Stewart. “Spending millions to flood the airwaves with greenwashing ads is a key part of oil companies’ strategy to delay action on climate change, so we are urging the Competition Bureau to rigorously enforce truth-in-advertising standards set by international bodies like the United Nations’ anti-greenwashing taskforce.” The Greenpeace Canada submission to the Competition Bureau consultation included data from a survey conducted for Greenpeace [1] that found: In its submission to the Competition Bureau’s consultation, Greenpeace supports the new legislation and identifies two reputable international standards for evaluating net-zero claims: the Integrity Matters framework established by the United Nations High Level Expert Group on Net Zero Emissions Commitments of Non‑State Entities (chaired by Canada’s former Environment Minister Catherine McKenna) and a framework specific to the oil industry established by the International Energy Agency. As noted in its submission, Greenpeace Canada has assessed net zero claims by Canadian banks and oil companies against these frameworks and found they do not meet these criteria. The Competition Bureau is currently investigating Greenpeace Canada’s 2023 complaint alleging that the ‘net zero’ ad campaign by the six largest oil sands companies (the Pathways Alliance) contained false and misleading claims. “Canada is finally joining jurisdictions like the EU and Australia that are cracking down on greenwashing,” said Greenpeace Canada legal counsel Priyanka Vittal. “We have proposed ways for these rules to be applied firmly but fairly, so that fossil fuel companies don’t have an unfair advantage against their clean energy competitors.” ENDS Notes to editor: [1] The data are based on a polling hosted by Angus Reid Forum between September 16 and September 18, 2024 among a representative sample of 1,515 online Canadians who are members of the Angus Reid Forum.

The actors, athletes and activists, from the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa and Oceania, signed an open letter calling on global leaders to champion a strong plastics agreement and “to agree to end single-use plastics.” They join the 80% of people who – according to a poll commissioned by Greenpeace International – support cuts to plastic production. “As concerned citizens, we support efforts at big events to reduce single-use plastics, clean up our beaches, and separate our plastic waste at home. However, none of this is enough—it hasn’t been enough for a long time. We live in a broken system dominated by throwaway plastic, and no solution or policy will be sufficient unless we reduce the amount of plastic produced and used,” said the letter. The final UN negotiations for a Global Plastics Treaty will take place in Busan, South Korea from November 25 to December 1, 2024, and are expected to produce a legally binding agreement that will curb the global plastics crisis. Greenpeace is demanding that the Global Plastics Treaty cut total plastic production by at least 75% by 2040 to protect biodiversity and ensure that global temperatures stay below 1.5° C. Over 99% of plastic is made from fossil fuels, and with production set to skyrocket, it is a significant driver of climate change. “I won a swimming marathon inspired by my late dog. Would politicians win the race to Busan inspired by the only planet we have?” Sharon van Rouwendaal, 2024 Paris Olympics gold medalist said. Graham Forbes, Greenpeace USA’s Global Plastics Campaign Lead and Head of Delegation of the Global Plastics Treaty negotiations, said: “Governments must not waste time listening to the fossil fuel and petrochemical industries who trade our future for profit.

And the spot they have in mind — an area located in the Norwegian Sea — is roughly the size of New Brunswick. The effect on wildlife will be devastating. In response, Greenpeace has teamed up with scientists and campaigners and set sail to the proposed mining site on our vessel, The Witness . Our mission: study the cetaceans — whale, dolphin and porpoise species — who will be directly threatened by the destructive impacts of this mining, broadcast our findings, and pressure the Norwegian government to ditch their plans. The proposed mining area features underwater mountains and ridges, which are vital habitats for many marine species, including whales and dolphins, who rely on them for feeding, breeding, and navigation. “Although it has long been known that whales and dolphins live in this area, we still know remarkably little about their abundance, distribution and behaviours, including how much they rely on healthy ecosystems around seamounts,” explains David Santillo, Senior Scientist at the Greenpeace Science Unit. Yet Norwegian mining companies plan to extract mineral-rich crusts from these very seamounts, jeopardizing centuries-old ecosystems. They also intend to mine hydrothermal vents — openings in the seafloor that release heated mineral-rich water — which are essential for some deep-sea creatures. Norway has already received significant international criticism, with over 800 marine scientists calling for a pause on deep-sea mining. So far, it’s been to no avail: the Norwegian government still seems willing to risk the health and stability of these fragile ecosystems in the interests of corporate profit. “Norway’s plans not only directly threaten species and habitats on the seabed due to the mining machines, but also the wider marine ecosystem, from the tiniest plankton to the great whales,” explains Santillo. © Christian Åslund / Greenpeace. The fluke of a sperm whale is spotted in front of Greenpeace’s sailing vessel, The Witness, during our Norwegian Deep-Sea Mining ship tour. And while research is underway to understand the harms that will come from this new practice, we continue to discover new ways the deep-sea plays an important role for the entire planet. For example, a recent scientific study revealed that polymetallic nodules in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone — an area in the Pacific Ocean that is also a target for mining — could play a crucial role in oxygen production in the deep-sea. “Our expedition onboard The Witness enables us to look and listen with minimum disturbance, and should help us fill some of those gaps in scientific knowledge at a time and in an area where no-one else is watching,” says Santillo. So far we’ve found that the region is home to several groups of sperm whales, orcas, fin whales, dolphins, and minke whales, but there’s so much more to discover — and protect. The Norwegian government’s push for mining, despite the lack of understanding of its impacts, is irresponsible. But there’s still time to prevent it, and we won’t stop advocating for our oceans — and all of their unique and vital ecosystems — until all governments sign a moratorium on deep-sea mining.

A series of falsehoods and threats have swirled in the two weeks since Hurricane Helene tore through six states causing several hundred deaths, followed by Milton crashing into Florida on Wednesday. The extent of the misinformation, which has been stoked by Donald Trump and his followers, has been such that it has stymied the ability to help hurricane-hit communities, according to the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema). Katie Nickolaou, a Michigan-based meteorologist, said that she and her colleagues have borne the brunt of much of these conspiracies, having received messages claiming there are category 6 hurricanes (there aren’t), that meteorologists or the government are creating and directing hurricanes (they aren’t) and even that scientists should be killed and radar equipment be demolished. “I’ve never seen a storm garner so much misinformation, we have just been putting out fires of wrong information everywhere,” Nickolaou said. “I have had a bunch of people saying I created and steered the hurricane, there are people assuming we control the weather. I have had to point out that a hurricane has the energy of 10,000 nuclear bombs and we can’t hope to control that. But it’s taken a turn to more violent rhetoric, especially with people saying those who created Milton should be killed.” One post aimed at Nickolaou said: “Stop the breathing of those that made them and their affiliates.” She responded : “Murdering meteorologists won’t stop hurricanes. I can’t believe I just had to type that.” “People have called me a plethora of curse words, people telling me to shut up and sit down, people who think it’s OK to take out Doppler radar because they think it is controlling the weather,” Nickolaou said. “It is eating up a lot of work and free time to deal with all of this. It’s very tiring.” A wide range of misinformation has been spread as Helene and then Milton gathered pace in the Gulf of Mexico, such as claims spread by Trump that Fema had run out of cash for hurricane survivors because it has been given to illegal immigrants. Violent threats have also become common, with posts across TikTok , Facebook and X (formerly known as Twitter), alleging that Fema workers should be beaten or “arrested or shot or hung on sight”. More outlandishly, several of Trump’s closest allies have baselessly asserted that the federal government is somehow controlling hurricanes. “Hurricane Helene was an ATTACK caused by Weather Manipulation,” claimed a video shared by Michael Flynn, a former national security advisor to Trump. “Yes they can control the weather,” Marjorie Taylor Greene , a far-right congresswoman, wrote on X last week. “It’s ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can’t be done.” This steep rise in falsehoods has drawn a sharp response from Joe Biden , who has blamed Trump for an “onslaught of lies” and told the former president to “get a life.” “It’s beyond ridiculous,” Biden said of the claims being made around weather control. “It’s so stupid. It’s got to stop.” Although humans can worsen hurricanes by burning fossil fuels, creating a hotter ocean and atmosphere that gives hurricanes more energy, they cannot create, control or steer individual storms. Also, Fema’s disaster relief fund for hurricane-hit communities is separate from and unaffected by the money spent on giving shelter to migrants. But for meteorologists, the experiences around Helene and Milton are just an extreme continuation of a trend where the public is increasingly getting its information from extremist figures online rather than experts, according to Chris Gloninger, a former TV meteorologist and climate scientist who faced threats for talking about the climate crisis during his forecasts. “The modern Republican party has an army of people who are on social media with huge followings who just disseminate this misinformation,” Gloninger said. “I’m seeing my former colleagues getting threats, I’m getting messages that we are steering hurricanes into red states. It’s mindblowing, I’ve never seen anything like this in any disaster.” Gloninger said that meteorologists are “going to reach a point of burnout. What other profession are people targeted for simply doing their job? All we are trying to do is protect life and property during extreme weather.” Sign up to The Stakes — US Election Edition","Meteorologists have been targeted by a deluge of conspiracy theories that they were controlling the weather, abuse and even death threats.

But some chose to stay, even though officials warned Hurricane Milton would turn their homes into coffins. Along Florida’s Gulf coast, where millions of people were urged to get out of harm’s way, cities were largely deserted on Wednesday afternoon as time ran out to evacuate. Those who remained were advised to shelter in place as best they could. Others who fled spoke of their dread at what, if anything, they would return to once the storm had passed. “I’m fearful that I’m not going to have a house, that it’s going to just be demolished. I’m fearful that my island is going to sink into the water,” said Amanda Champ, who evacuated with her husband, children and two dogs to Alabama on Monday from their home on Anna Maria island, just north of Sarasota. “I’m fearful that everybody’s belongings are going to be floating around, that there’s just not going to be a way to even get back there. I don’t know what to expect.” William Tokajer, police chief of Holmes Beach, told islanders who planned to stay to write their names, dates of birth and social security numbers on their limbs with Sharpies to help identify their bodies after the storm. His alarming words resonated with Champ, and the rest of Anna Maria’s population of about 1,000, reinforcing a message they had been hearing for days. Tokajer said Wednesday that he didn’t believe any residents stayed behind. “I am a strong believer that things are just things, and that people, the memories, your friends and family, that’s what matters, and how you live your life,” said Champ, who is known as the coconut lady on Anna Maria island for her business selling coconuts to tourists and locals. “When we were packing to leave my nine-year-old son said ‘Mom, I don’t need anything’. He didn’t want to take anything, he just brought clothes. He’s like, ‘There’s people that need stuff more than me’.” Champ and her family relocated to a condo in Gulf Shores, Alabama, where she spent Wednesday preparing her coconut stall for a prearranged shrimp festival. It was a welcome distraction from hurricane anxiety, she said. Messaging from local authorities, she said, had been perfectly clear. “They were going around telling people to leave,” she said. “We just pray that everyone listened and evacuated.” In Venice, about 40 miles (64km) to the south, Sherry Hall and her family decided to stay in their house several blocks from the ocean, despite many of their neighbors leaving amid warnings of a storm surge up to 15ft. Her husband, Tommy, prepared the property with shutters and sandbags, and she said they had generators, portable air conditioning units, and plenty of water and food to be self-sufficient. The couple, with their 18-year-old son Devin, did not want get tangled in heavy traffic on evacuation routes, or drive hours searching for hotels. But she said she was still apprehensive, and had heard Gulf waves crashing on the beach during previous storms. “I’m not saying that I’m not worried. I’m not worried about me or my husband, but when you have children you worry about them,” she said. “As far as life-threatening and all that, we have good faith in the Lord, and we hope and pray for everyone, not just us. Items can be replaced but life isn’t about things, it’s about people and keeping people safe.” Hall, a hospital administration worker, said although some neighbors left, many others had remained. All, however, had made their decisions aware of authorities’ warnings , she said. “Word of the storm has got out nicely. They share with you that at a certain point they cannot come and rescue you, they’re telling people, you know, if you decide to stay, that’s on your own risk and on your life, basically,” she said. “They also tell you it might be a while until the storm’s over and we don’t know when we’re going to get to you. They let the public know. Do I think a lot of people listened this time? Yeah, I think a lot of people have left. And then there are the ones that try to just hunker down as best as they can.” Christine Bottger, general manager of the Clearwater Beach Holiday Inn, was another who opted to stay. “We’re in a pretty safe area and a pretty sound house, and honestly by the time I would have been able to leave, we would be stuck without a hotel room, then perhaps be stuck on an interstate, not where I want to be in the middle of a storm,” she said. She said the waterfront hotel suffered significant damage and was flooded by two feet of water in Hurricane Helene two weeks ago, and contractors were in as recently as Monday to start measuring up for repairs. Now Bottger fears any wind damage from Milton will bring further delay, although she said the hotel’s staff of about 120, who she calls a family, will be eager to help with the clean-up. She said that even if the hotel cannot reopen for guests, its rooms could shelter first responders and essential workers to help speed the city’s recovery. “We can get the power companies in and give them a clean room with a comfortable bed, and help get the infrastructure that’s needed back up and running,” she said. “It helps everybody. The pool has 2ft of sand in it and the restaurant was wrecked in Helene, but they won’t be using those.” Like Champ and Hall, Bottger said warnings from local officials to those who needed to evacuate were clear and on point, and that residents were more likely to listen to those than more general messaging from state or federal authorities. “The city manager and police chief were driving around yesterday afternoon on the beach, just checking everything before the bridges to the barrier islands were closed,” she said. “They felt most people were heeding the warning. This time around people noticed the intensity and started taking it seriously when they saw 180mph winds being talked about. It opened their eyes.”","Amanda Champ evacuated with her husband, children and two dogs to Alabama.

3952,2024-10-09 20:00:02,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/08/hurricane-milton-strength-intensity-explainer,Hurricane Milton: what causes such intense storms?,Climate Change,Public Health & Environment,"The speed with which recent hurricanes have been intensifying in strength is alarming climate experts, officials and residents facing these huge storms. More than a million people were told to evacuate as Hurricane Milton hit Florida’s west coast. Milton is the third fastest-intensifying storm on record in the Atlantic Ocean, the US National Weather Service has said as experts warn the climate crisis is fueling more powerful storms. Milton made landfall on Florida’s central Gulf coast late on Wednesday as a category 3 storm. Forecasters said Milton will remain “an extremely dangerous hurricane”, and the National Hurricane Center warned of “life-threatening storm surges, extreme winds and flash flooding”. Joe Biden, who postponed an overseas trip so he could remain at the White House to monitor Milton, warned that it “could be one of the worst storms in 100 years to hit Florida”. With swathes of the US south still reeling from the disastrous Hurricane Helene , the rapid advance of Hurricane Milton caught many off guard. Within barely a day, Milton went from a tropical storm to a category 5 hurricane, the strongest possible rating, with its winds hitting 180mph as it barreled across the Gulf of Mexico toward the heart of Florida. The storm underwent “rapid intensification”, which is when a storm increases by at least 35mph (56 kmph) over a 24-hour period. Milton’s blistering pace obliterated this benchmark, accelerating by 90mph in around 25 hours, according to the research group Climate Central. It later receded to a category 3. “This is nothing short of astronomical,” said Noah Bergren, a Florida-based meteorologist. “This hurricane is nearing the mathematical limit of what Earth’s atmosphere over this ocean water can produce.” As hurricanes form, their strength is determined by a number of factors such as thunderstorms and wind shear that can disrupt the tight circular organization of the storm. A key determinant of rapid intensification, though, is the heat content of the ocean and atmosphere. Hotter air and water provides greater energy to a storm, making it spin faster and ladening it with more moisture that is then dumped onto communities in torrents of rainfall, causing flooding. Crucially, the Gulf of Mexico has been reaching record temperatures for much of this year, with its waters likened to a bathtub over the summer. The core of Milton is passing over some exceptionally warm water, around 3F to 5F (2C to 3C) hotter than average for this time of year. Milton is being turbocharged by excess heat, much like Helene was just two weeks ago. While hurricanes have always formed in this part of the world, scientists are clear that global heating, caused by the burning of fossil fuels, is likely making storms faster, stronger and wetter. A study published last year found that tropical cyclones in the Atlantic are now around 29% more likely to rapidly intensify compared to the period between 1971 and 1990. Separate research has found that natural variability alone can’t explain the increases in rapidly intensifying storms, pointing to the role of climate change. Milton joins a growing list of storms that have quickly accelerated into catastrophic, life-changing hurricanes in recent years, such as Hurricane Harvey in 2017, Hurricane Laura in 2020, Hurricane Ida in 2021 and Hurricane Ian in 2022, which underwent two different rounds of rapid intensification. In total, there have been as many category 4 or 5 Atlantic hurricanes to hit the US since 2017 as there have been in the prior 57 years. “We are witnessing a genuinely extraordinary and regionally quite deadly and destructive period for extreme weather in the United States,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA. “And, quite frankly, the fingerprints of the climate [crisis] are all over what has transpired in recent weeks.” For those on the west coast of Florida, a state that has seen its population boom over the past decade, the one-two punch of Helene and Milton is set to be disastrous, requiring months or even years of rebuilding and piecing together shattered lives. Longer term, the reach of the climate crisis, including more intense storms, will only increase as global temperatures continue to rise. This means not only more death and destruction, but also portends a fundamental shift in where it is considered “safe” to live, as climate impacts hit supposedly benign regions and insurers pull out from covering homes and businesses amid mounting financial losses. The climate crisis has forced its way onto the US presidential election agenda in the most spectacular, and grim, way possible.","Milton is the third fastest-intensifying storm on record in the Atlantic Ocean.

Milton is being turbocharged by excess heat, much like Helene was just two weeks ago. Scientists are clear that global heating, caused by the burning of fossil fuels, is likely making storms faster, stronger and wetter. Longer, the reach of the climate crisis, including more intense storms, will only increase.",http://res.cloudinary.com/drwsupfyj/image/upload/v1728703267/state-of-the-earth/news_photographs/hurricanemiltonwhatcausessuchintensestorms.jpg

DeSantis, who dropped his presidential campaign in January, is as governor responsible for implementing Florida’s emergency plan by coordinating agencies, marshaling resources and urging residents to follow evacuation orders. It’s a role he is unfit to play because of his record on the climate crisis, Florida activists say. “Florida isn’t safe with DeSantis at the helm of our state government,” said Matthew Grocholske, 20, campaign strategy lead with the Orlando, Florida, chapter of the youth-led Sunrise Movement. Less than two weeks after it was slammed by the deadly Hurricane Helene , the state is bracing for Hurricane Milton, a category 5 storm. Florida environmentalists say that DeSantis’s policies to boost fossil fuels , suppress carbon-free energy and ignore global heating have fueled the climate crisis that has exacerbated such hurricanes. Asked to comment on the criticism from environmentalists, Julia Friedland, the governor’s deputy press secretary, said: “You, and your publication, are despicable for running nonsense stories like this the day a major hurricane is making landfall in Florida.” DeSantis on Wednesday urged millions of Floridians in Milton’s expected path to evacuate. “We are bracing and are prepared to receive a major hit,” he said . Hurricanes – including Helene – are becoming more dangerous due to the climate crisis , caused primarily by the burning of fossil fuels. DeSantis’s policies have fueled that crisis with his policies and rhetoric, climate advocates say. “When it comes to our climate crisis, Ron DeSantis is easily the worst governor in Florida’s history,” said Delaney Reynolds, 25, a PhD student in climate resilience at the University of Miami and lead plaintiff in a 2018 youth-led climate lawsuit against the state government. DeSantis’s opposition to climate action began early in his career. One day after taking office in 2013, the then representative voted against a measure proposed after Hurricane Sandy to guarantee people could collect on federal flood insurance claims. During his 2018 run for governor, he pledged to protect Florida’s Everglades and waterways. But though he admitted that “human activity contributes to changes in the environment”, he also said: “I am not a global warming person.” More recently, he has gone further, slamming climate action as “woke”. There is ample evidence that warmer ocean temperatures fuel more powerful storms, and preliminary studies show Helene’s strength was made far more likely by global heating. Yet as Florida was battered by record-breaking rain this past June, DeSantis staunchly denied any potential link to the climate crisis . “This clearly is not unprecedented,” he said at a news conference at the time. “I think the difference is, you compare 50 to 100 years ago to now, there’s just a lot more that’s been developed, so there’s a lot more effects that this type of event can have.” In August, DeSantis’s administration sparked outcry for its so-called Great Outdoors Initiative , which included plans to pave over thousands of acres at nine state parks and erect 350-room hotels, golf courses and pickleball courts. In May, the governor made headlines for signing legislation scrubbing most references to climate change from state law. The policy, which took effect on 1 July, restructured the state’s energy policy to nullify goals to boost wind and solar, instead focusing on hardening energy infrastructure against “natural and manmade threats”. “We’re restoring sanity in our approach to energy and rejecting the agenda of the radical green zealots,” DeSantis posted on X . During his run for president in the 2024 Republican primary, DeSantis also promised to ramp up domestic oil and gas production and fend off electric vehicle mandates, moves that climate experts warned would have boosted greenhouse gas emissions. His promises rhymed with his state policies. This past legislative session, DeSantis reportedly quietly helped craft a ban on wind energy infrastructure in Florida. And he also signed a far-reaching energy omnibus bill boosting the gas industry and increasing the barriers to purchasing electric vehicles. “The Florida we grew up loving is slipping away with each storm, and DeSantis is ignoring that,” said Yoca Arditi-Rocha, executive director of the Miami-based non-profit Cleo Institute, which advocates for climate education. “We’re losing the places that define who we are as Floridians, and DeSantis is moving us in that direction, ignoring this crisis in his own back yard because of political reasons.” Last year, DeSantis turned down federal aid for energy efficiency, electrification and slashing carbon pollution . In 2022, he vetoed from the state budget a $5m allocation for a hurricane shelter in a north-east Florida town, and barred the state’s pension fund from making investment decisions that consider the climate crisis. The previous year, he adopted a bill banning Florida’s cities from adopting 100% clean energy goals. Such policies have exacerbated the climate crisis, which fuels hurricanes like Milton and Helene, Grocholske said. “The catastrophic level of this hurricane is directly due to the policies our state government is passing,” said Grocholske. “It’s clear that [DeSantis’s] administration has been one of the biggest threats to climate justice our state has faced in its history.” Perplexingly, as DeSantis has attacked climate efforts, he has backed environmental conservation, saying he channels the conservationist president Theodore Roosevelt. This year alone, he announced funds to restore the Everglades, address harmful algae blooms , and directed revenue generated from a tribal compact to fund flood control and water quality improvement . Arditi-Rocha said her organization “applauds” DeSantis’s conservation efforts, noting some of them could help protect the health of crucial carbon sinks. But those moves cannot make up for his pro-fossil fuel policies, she said. “Climate change is this overflowing bathroom, and DeSantis is coming in with towels,” she said. “He’s putting on more and more towels without turning off the faucet, without tackling the root of the problem.” DeSantis often describes his conservation initiatives as economically beneficial. But by increasing carbon emissions, he is costing the state money and lives, said Reynolds. “Frankly, he should be given a special merit of honor for so overtly, consistently and consciously failing to address the cause of our climate crisis,” she said. “What he has done will tragically cost our state untold billions, if not trillions, of damage for generations to come.”","Ron DeSantis is responsible for implementing Florida’s emergency plan.

4208,2024-10-11 16:00:59,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/12/tanya-plibersek-defends-aboriginal-heritage-order-blocking-irreversible-damage-of-goldmine-tailings-dam,Tanya Plibersek defends Aboriginal heritage order blocking ‘irreversible damage’ of goldmine tailings dam,Politics & Law,Public Health & Environment,"Tanya Plibersek has defended her decision to issue an Aboriginal heritage protection order for the site of a proposed goldmine near Blayney, saying the financial impact on the mining company does not outweigh “irreversible damage and permanent loss” to Aboriginal cultural heritage sites. The environment minister made a partial declaration under section 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act in August, blocking a proposal by mining company Regis Resources to build a tailings dam for its $900m McPhillamys gold project in the headwaters of the Belubula River. The declaration did not cover the rest of the proposed mining area. Regis said at the time that the decision “made the project in its current form unviable”. In a 22-page statement on Friday, Plibersek said she noted that Regis had considered 30 alternative sites for a tailings dam, but recognised that the protection order would make the mine “unviable in the state in which it is currently proposed and approved”. “However, having considered all the submissions and material available to me in relation to the proprietary and pecuniary impacts of the making of a declaration over the specified area, I was satisfied that the proprietary and pecuniary impacts to the proponent and others do not outweigh the irreversible damage and permanent loss to the Aboriginal cultural heritage in the declared area,” she wrote. “The long-term effect on cultural heritage is permanent, and the loss of cultural heritage cannot be mitigated or reversed.” Regis Resources declined to comment further on Friday. The cultural heritage protection was welcomed by some traditional owners, locals and farmers. However, it was criticised by the mining industry, business groups and the mayor of the local council, and the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said he would overturn it if the Coalition won government next year. The decision was also criticised by the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council (NSWALC), which said it was concerned that Aboriginal cultural heritage had been used “as a pawn for political posturing and advantage”. NSWALC represents the Orange Local Aboriginal Land Council (OLALC). The section 10 application was made by Wiradyuri elder Aunty Nyree Reynolds, who is represented by the Bathurst-based Wiradyuri Traditional Owners Central West Aboriginal Corporation (WTOCWAC). Both groups represent Wiradyuri peoples. Plibersek found that the Belubula River, headwaters and springs were “of particular significance to Wiradjuri people” and that the proposed construction of the tailings dam, which would involve plugging the springs with concrete, was “inconsistent with the treatment of waterways within Aboriginal tradition and pose a threat of injury or desecration to the area”. “Irreversible damage to the Belubula River headwaters would remain, despite proposed restoration of the mine site,” she said. Plibersek said even Regis’s conceptual drawings of the area post-rehabilitation showed the river to be “significantly modified”. “Development of the [tailings storage facility] would involve plugging the springs with cement and the TSF may cause water pollution, which would not only threaten water quality in the Lachlan-Murray basin, but will sever Wiradjuri connection to the specific area,” she said. She also found that state heritage laws would not offer sufficient protection, citing a letter from the NSW environment minister, Penny Sharpe, who said intangible cultural heritage values were “not currently protected under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 unless an Aboriginal place is gazetted”, which this proposed site was not. Those laws also do not apply to approved state significant developments. The basis of the protection declaration was a claim that the Belubula River, headwaters and springs were the site of pre-initiation ceremonies in Wiradyuri culture and that the river itself was the subject of the Blue Banded Bee dreaming. Another area, the Dungeon Burial site, was found to be a significant Aboriginal site but not at risk from the proposed mine. The OLALC said it had no evidence or knowledge of the use of the area for ceremonial purposes. It also provided a statement from six people, including five Wiradyuri people, disputing the existence of any dreaming or creation story relating to the Blue Banded Bee. But Plibersek said WTOCWAC was “an established group of accepted community elders” and she was “satisfied that WTOCWAC had demonstrated that the individuals who provided the statements hold knowledge of traditions, customs and beliefs relating to the specified area”. She cited Dinawan Dyirribang Uncle Bill Allen, a senior Wiradyuri elder and descendent of the Wiradyuri warrior Windradyne, who said the area was “like a big university for our young fellas to come to get their learning”. She wrote that she understood that both the OLALC and Regis disputed that the area was used for ceremonial purposes but said she was “satisfied that this lack of knowledge is consistent with Aboriginal tradition that not all people are aware of the location of such ceremonies, particularly where those ceremonies pertain to men’s or women’s business”. On the Blue Banded Bee dreaming, she said OLALC’s comments were “consistent with WTOCWAC’s submission that the dreaming is knowledge that is only passed to specific custodians in accordance with Aboriginal oral tradition”. She added that the elder responsible for the story was in hospital at the time the initial section 10 report was compiled.

Almost 50,000 people have signed a petition calling on the EA and Surrey county council to reroute the flood channel away from the lake, which is a site of nature conservation. But the EA and Surrey council seem likely to press ahead with the 50-metre wide channel, bisecting the lake and feeding river floodwater into its centre. Ferris Meadow Lake hosts an annual 24-hour charity swim for Level Water , raising money to provide access to swimming for disabled children across the UK. Bathing water quality is regularly tested and is excellent. Emma Pattinson, whose family have owned the lake since the 1960s, opened it up for swimming in 2010. By 2024 the lake had hosted a quarter of a million swims, as swimming in nature grew in popularity, with research showing how beneficial it is to mental health. “People love swimming here because they are surrounded by nature, and because the water is healthy and supports wildlife and a varied ecosystem. It is a massive boost to people’s mental health,” said Pattinson. “Our water quality is always excellent. Surfers Against Sewage have tested the water quality in the River Thames next door to the lake and these tests show high levels of enterococci and coliform bacteria. “If this channel is cut through the middle of our lake it will bring in sewage pollution but also contaminate the water with metals and PFAS chemicals. We are talking about a lake, not a flowing body of water, so the pollution will just sit there. “I would just not be happy running the lake as a swimming location in that case because I won’t be able to account for the water quality.” Pattinson said digging into the lake would also disrupt the delicate ecosystems that have built over decades. Her family have owned the lake since it was a gravel pit, and won nature awards for its restoration when it was filled in. The lake is now a site of nature conservation. Pattinson said she had been consulting with the EA since the plan was first dicussed in 2009 and by 2014 it was clear it wanted to channel flood water into the lake. “They really treated us as insignificant the whole way along,” she said. “They dismissed us. When they saw how many people swim here, they were a bit shocked and then they saw the size of the petition and they agreed to do a second consultation on the chosen route of the channel. “That has just closed but they are still insisting that the channel has to come through the lake. We believe there are other options which can avoid the lake, but the EA is fixed on this because it has been so long in the planning and they are reluctant to look at this again.” The River Thames scheme has been designed with two channels to divert flood water and help protect 11,000 homes. It involves digging two new river channels to divert flood water, one of which, the Spelthorne channel, will bisect Ferris Meadow Lake. The UK has very few inland bathing water areas compared with other European countries. An EA spokesperson said: “The River Thames scheme represents a landmark opportunity to manage flood risk while enhancing the environment for generations to come. Through integrating green infrastructure, we are committed to creating a sustainable solution that benefits both people and nature.” Sign up to Down to Earth","Ferris Meadow Lake hosts an annual 24-hour charity swim for Level Water.

Two days of rainfall in September exceeded yearly averages in several areas of south-east Morocco and caused a deluge, officials of the country’s meteorology agency said in early October. In Tagounite, a village about 450km(280 miles) south of the capital, Rabat, more than 100mm (3.9 inches) was recorded in a 24-hour period. Satellite imagery from Nasa showed Lake Iriqui, a lake bed between Zagora and Tata that had been dry for 50 years, being filled up. “It’s been 30 to 50 years since we’ve had this much rain in such a short space of time,’ Houssine Youabeb, an official of Morocco’s meteorology agency told the Associated Press. Such rains, which meteorologists call an extratropical storm, may change the weather conditions in the region in the coming months and years. As the air holds more moisture, it promotes evaporation and provokes more storms, Youabeb said. The flooding in Morocco killed 18 people last month, with the impact stretching to regions that had been affected by an earthquake last year. There were also reports of dammed reservoirs in the south-east region refilling at record rates throughout September. The Sahara, which at 9.4m sq km (3.6m sq miles) is the world’s largest hot desert, stretches across a dozen countries in north, central and west Africa. Recurring drought has been a problem in many of these countries as extreme weather events are on the rise due to global heating. That has led to predictions from scientists that similar storms could happen in the Sahara in the future. Celeste Saulo, the secretary general of the World Meteorological Organization, told reporters on Monday that water cycles across the world were changing with increasing frequency. “As a result of rising temperatures, the hydrological cycle has accelerated. It has also become more erratic and unpredictable, and we are facing growing problems of either too much or too little water,” she said.","Two days of rainfall in September exceeded yearly averages in several areas of south-east Morocco.

Last year, Multnomah county sued 17 fossil fuel companies and interest groups for allegedly deceiving the public about the climate crisis . The lawsuit came two years after a record-shattering heat dome killed 69 people across the county. Research shows the climate crisis greatly exacerbated the 2021 temperature surge. Oil and gas companies, which fuel global warming, should pay climate damages, the lawsuit argues. On Monday, the county announced that it has amended its complaint to include the gas utility NW Natural, Oregon’s oldest and largest fossil fuel company. “NW Natural engaged in an enterprise of misrepresentation about the effects its products would have on the climate,” the amended litigation says. NW Natural is responsible for some 9% of Oregon’s carbon dioxide emissions, the lawsuit alleges, arguing that it has also disseminated misinformation about the climate dangers of gas. Gas is primarily made of methane, a greenhouse gas 80 times more planet-heating than carbon dioxide. The county’s move could open the door for more litigation against utilities, said Alyssa Johl, vice-president of legal and general counsel at the Center for Climate Integrity, which tracks and supports climate deception lawsuits. “Gas utilities have been significant players in the historic and ongoing deception campaigns to mislead the public about the dangers of fossil fuels,” she said. Though NW Natural has touted its commitment to a “carbon neutral future”, the company “has not implemented any operational changes that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Oregon”, the lawsuit says. It also accuses the company of “astroturfing” community support for gas. NW Natural declined to comment, saying it had not yet reviewed the suit. Last month, a ProPublica investigation found that, despite public claims to be lowering its emissions, NW Natural has made little effort to achieve that goal. Lawmakers and advocates have for years urged the state’s department of justice to investigate the utility for false advertising. The amended complaint also names the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine – a non-profit that environmentalists have long said spreads climate denial – marking the first such suit against the group. The original complaint was also the first to target the multinational consulting firm McKinsey & Company, which has long worked with big oil. Multnomah county is one of two dozen cities, counties and states across the US that have filed charges of climate deception against the fossil fuel industry. It seeks $50bn in damages from the 2021 heat dome and additional $1.5bn for future climate damages. “We’re already paying dearly in Multnomah County for our climate crisis – with our tax dollars, with our health and with our lives,” the county chair, Jessica Vega, Pederson said in a statement. “Going forward we have to strengthen our safety net just to keep people safe.”","Last year, Multnomah county sued 17 fossil fuel companies and interest groups for allegedly deceiving the public about the climate crisis.

4720,2024-10-04 14:00:05,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/04/exported-liquefied-natural-gas-coal-study,"Exported gas produces far worse emissions than coal, major study finds",Climate Change,Public Health & Environment,"Exported gas emits far more greenhouse gas emissions than coal, despite fossil-fuel industry claims it is a cleaner alternative, according to a major new research paper that challenges the controversial yet rapid expansion of gas exports from the US to Europe and Asia. Coal is the dirtiest of fossil fuels when combusted for energy, with oil and gas producers for years promoting cleaner-burning gas as a “bridge” fuel and even a “climate solution” amid a glut of new liquefied natural gas (or LNG) terminals, primarily in the US. But the research, which itself has become enmeshed in a political argument in the US, has concluded that LNG is 33% worse in terms of planet-heating emissions over a 20-year period compared with coal. “The idea that coal is worse for the climate is mistaken – LNG has a larger greenhouse gas footprint than any other fuel,” said Robert Howarth, an environmental scientist at Cornell University and author of the new paper. “To think we should be shipping around this gas as a climate solution is just plain wrong. It’s greenwashing from oil and gas companies that has severely underestimated the emissions from this type of energy.” Drilling, moving, cooling and shipping gas from one country to another uses so much energy that the actual final burning of gas in people’s homes and businesses only accounts for about a third of the total emissions from this process, the research finds. The large resulting emissions mean there is “no need for LNG as an interim energy source”, the paper says, adding that “ending the use of LNG should be a global priority”. The peer-reviewed research, published on Thursday in the Energy Science & Engineering journal , challenges the rationale for a huge surge in LNG facilities along the US Gulf coast, in order to send gas in huge tankers to overseas markets. The US is the world’s leading LNG exporter , followed by Australia and Qatar. Previous government and industry estimates have assumed that LNG is considerably lower emitting than coal, offering the promise that it could replace it in countries such as China, as well as aiding European allies menaced by the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, a major gas producer. “US LNG exports can help accelerate environmental progress across the globe, enabling nations to transition to cleaner natural gas to reduce emissions and address the global risks of climate change,” Dustin Meyer, director of market development at the American Petroleum Institute, has said. But scientists have determined that LNG expansion is not compatible with the world avoiding dangerous global heating, with researchers finding in recent years the leakage of methane, a primary component of gas and a potent planet-heating agent, from drilling operations is far higher than official estimates. Howarth’s paper finds that as much as 3.5% of the gas delivered to customers leaks to the atmosphere unburned, much more than previously assumed. Methane is about 80 times more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, even though it persists for less time in the atmosphere, and scientists have warned that rising global methane emissions risk blowing apart agreed-upon climate goals. Howarth’s research found that during LNG production, around half of the total emissions occur during the long journey taken by gas as it is pushed through pipelines to coastal terminals after it is initially drilled, usually via hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, from areas such as the US’s vast shale deposits. The energy used to do this, along with the leaks, causes pollution that is exacerbated once the gas gets to the export facilities. There, it is supercooled to -162C (-260F) to become a liquid, which is loaded into huge storage containers on tankers. The tankers then travel long distances to deliver the product to client countries, where it is turned back into a gas and then burned. “This whole process is much more energy intensive than coal,” said Howarth. “The science is pretty clear here: it’s wishful thinking that the gas miraculously moves overseas without any emissions..” Howarth’s paper has caused something of a firestorm before its publication, with a draft of the study highlighted by climate campaigners such as Bill McKibben to the extent it was reportedly a factor in a decision earlier this year by the Biden administration to pause all new export permits for LNG projects. This pause has enraged the oil and gas industry – prompting lawsuits – and its political allies. Last month, four congressional Republicans wrote to the US energy department demanding correspondence between it and Howarth over what they called his “flawed” and “erroneous” study. Gas-friendly groups have also argued that the paper overstates emissions from LNG, an stance echoed by some energy experts. “It’s hard to swallow,” said David Dismukes, a leading Louisiana energy consultant and researcher. “Does gas have a climate impact? Absolutely. But is it worse than coal? Come on.” Howarth said the result of this unusual scrutiny was “more peer review than I’ve ever had before”, with five rounds of review being conducted by eight other scientists. Howarth said: “I don’t consider the criticism valid at all – it feels like a political job.” Howarth said the US has a “huge choice” to make in the presidential election, with Donald Trump vowing to undo Biden’s pause on his first day back in the White House to allow a raft of new LNG projects. Kamala Harris, meanwhile, has backed away from a previous plan to ban fracking but has promised action on the climate crisis. More than 125 climate, environmental and health scientists wrote to the Biden administration last month to defend Howarth’s research and urge a continuation of the pause on LNG exports. The Howarth paper’s findings are “plausible”, said Drew Shindell, a climate scientist at Duke University, who was not involved in the research. “Bob’s study adds to a lot of literature now that shows the industry’s argument for gas is undermined by the option to go to renewables,” Shindell said. “The debate isn’t really about whether gas is slightly better or worse than coal, though. It should be about how both are terrible and that we need to get rid of both of them.” Sign up to Down to Earth","New research challenges the expansion of gas exports from the US to Europe and Asia.

4976,2024-09-29 14:00:33,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/29/leonard-leo-group-influencing-judges-climate-education,Leonard Leo-linked group attacking efforts to educate judges on climate,Climate Change,Politics & Law,"A rightwing organization is attacking efforts to educate judges about the climate crisis. The group appears to be connected to Leonard Leo, the architect of the rightwing takeover of the American judiciary who helped select Trump’s supreme court nominees, the Guardian has learned. The Washington DC-based non-profit Environmental Law Institute (ELI)’s Climate Judiciary Project holds seminars for lawyers and judges about the climate crisis. It aims to “provide neutral, objective information to the judiciary about the science of climate change as it is understood by the expert scientific community and relevant to current and future litigation”, according to ELI’s website. The American Energy Institute (AEI), a rightwing, pro-fossil fuel thinktank, has been attacking ELI and their climate trainings in recent months. In August, the organization published a report saying ELI was “corruptly influencing the courts and destroying the rule of law to promote questionable climate science”. ELI’s Climate Judiciary Project is “falsely portraying itself as a neutral entity teaching judges about questionable climate science”, the report says. In reality, AEI claims, the project is a partner to the more than two dozen US cities and states who are suing big oil for allegedly sowing doubt about the climate crisis despite longstanding knowledge of the climate dangers of coal, oil and gas usage. In a PowerPoint presentation about the report found on AEI’s website, the group says the Climate Judiciary Project (CJP) is a “wholly aligned with the climate change plaintiffs and helps them corruptly influence judges behind closed doors”. “Their true purpose is to preview the plaintiffs’ arguments in the climate cases in an ex parte setting,” the presentation says. Both the report and the PowerPoint presentation link AEI to CRC Advisors, a public relations firm chaired by rightwing dark money impresario Leo. Given his outsize role in shaping the US judiciary – Leo helped select multiple judicial nominees for former president Donald Trump, including personally lobbying for Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment – his firm’s role in opposing climate litigation is notable. “He was greatly responsible for moving our federal court systems to the right,” said David Armiak, the research director for Center for Media and Democracy, a watchdog group tracking money in politics, of Leo. CRC Advisors’ work with AEI, Armiak said, seemed “to delegitimize a group that’s seeking to inform judges or the judicial system of climate science, something that [Leo] also opposed with some of his other efforts”. The AEI report’s document properties show that its author was Maggie Howell, director of branding and design at CRC Advisors. And the PowerPoint’s document properties lists CRC Advisors’s vice-president, Kevin Daley, as the author. Neither CRC Advisors nor Leo responded to requests for comment. In an email, the American Energy Institute CEO, Jason Isaac, said: “American Energy Institute employed CRC Advisors to edit and promote our groundbreaking report on the corrupt relationship between our federal court system and leftwing dark money groups.” But Kert Davies, the director of special investigations at the non-profit Center for Climate Integrity, who shared the report and PowerPoint with the Guardian, said ELI is “far from leftwing”. The institute’s staff include a wide variety of legal and climate experts. Its board includes executives from Shell Group and BP, oil companies who have been named as defendants in climate litigation, and a partner at a law firm which represents Chevron. Two partners with the law firm Baker Botts LLP, which represents Sunoco LP and its subsidiary, Aloha Petroleum Ltd, in a climate lawsuit filed by Honolulu, also sit on ELI’s leadership council, E&E News previously reported . “ELI’s seminars are giving judges the ABCs of climate change, which is a complicated subject that they ought to know about,” said Davies. “The idea that they’re corruptly influencing the court from the left … is complete disinformation.” Asked for comment about ELI’s connection to oil companies, the AEI CEO, Isaac, said that “all of those companies have embraced and/or are pushing political agendas” that are “contrary to the best interest of Americans, American energy producers, and human flourishing”, including environmental social and governance (ESG) investing and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). “They are the appeasers, the ones feeding the crocodiles,” he said. He did not respond to questions about the extent of the relationship between AEI and CRC Advisors. In a statement, Nick Collins, a spokesperson for ELI, called the AEI report “full of misinformation and created by an organization whose leadership regularly spreads false claims about climate science”, and described the CJP curriculum as “fact-based and science-first, developed with a robust peer review process that meets the highest scholarly standards”. AEI’s attack on the judicial climate education program comes as the supreme court considers litigation that could put big oil on the hook for billions of dollars. Honolulu is one of dozens of cities and states to sue oil majors for allegedly hiding the dangers of their products from the public. Hawaii’s supreme court ruled that the suit can go to trial, but the defendants petitioned the US supreme court to review that decision, arguing the cases should be thrown out because emissions are a federal issue that cannot be tried in state courts. This past spring, far-right fossil fuel allies launched an unprecedented campaign pressuring the supreme court to side with the defendants and shield fossil fuel companies from the litigation. Several of the groups behind the campaign have ties to Leo. In June, the supreme court asked the Biden administration to weigh in on the defendants’ request. Biden officials could respond as soon as Monday. “It’s doubtful that AEI’s timing of their report release was a coincidence,” said Davies. The supreme court may weigh in on another case as early as Monday, too: in April, 20 Republican state attorneys general filed “friend of the court” briefs asking the supreme court to prevent states from being able to sue oil companies for climate damages. All of the signatories are members of the Republican Attorneys General Association , to which Leo’s Concord Fund is a major contributor. In the weeks since its publication, AEI’s report attacking ELI has received a surge of interest from rightwing media. Fox News featured the report, as did an array of conservative websites . On Thursday, the Hill published an op-ed by Ted Cruz attacking the ELI project. Other rightwing groups have previously questioned the motives of ELI. CRC Advisors has counted Chevron , one of the plaintiffs in Honolulu’s lawsuit, as a client. In 2018, the Leo-led PR firm also worked on a campaign aimed at exonerating the supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh from accusations of sexual assault. Davies said it “would not be surprising” if CRC Advisors had a “large role” in the creation or promotion of the AEI report attacking ELI’s judiciary trainings. “They’re known for running campaigns for corporate interests and rightwing interests,” he said. In addition to his work with AEI, Isaac also serves as a fellow at Texas Public Policy Foundation – a thinktank backed by oil and gas companies which has recently garnered scrutiny for its role in drafting the ultraconservative policy playbook Project 2025. A former Republican Texas state representative, Isaac has dedicated much of his career to disputing climate research and promoting misinformation to justify deregulation of the fossil fuel industry. Isaac recently responded to a Twitter post about Climate Week by the EPA, calling the conference on climate change “nothing more than a celebration of people suffering from mental illness, #EcoDysphoria, with those attending insisting the rest of us catch it.” On a 25 September episode of the rightwing Wisconsin talk radio show The Vicki McKenna Show, Isaac offered a defense of the fossil fuel industry, describing oil and gas as keys to prosperity. “I live a high-carbon lifestyle,” he said. “I wish the rest of the world could, too.” Formerly known as Texas Natural Gas Foundation, AEI on its face appears to contribute little more than public relations work in defense of the fossil fuels industry. The group publishes blogposts defending carbon emissions and denouncing the push for climate action. It has also produced a handful of longer reports promoting laws that restrict environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing and opposing the widespread adoption of electric vehicles. Among AEI’s board members are Steve Milloy, who served on Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency transition team, once ran a tobacco industry front group, and is a well-known climate denier. Milloy did not respond to a request for comment. According to the group’s most recent tax filings, AEI, which lists four staffers and a CEO on its website, is not a lavish operation. The group brought in about $312,000 in revenue in 2022 and appears to fund its operations at least partly by selling merchandise – among other products, AEI offers T-shirts, tote bags and beer koozies emblazoned with the words “I Embrace The High Carbon Lifestyle”.

The American Energy Institute (AEI), a rightwing, pro-fossil fuel thinktank, has been attacking ELI and their climate trainings in recent months.

4848,2024-10-01 21:49:34,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/01/trump-visits-georgia-denies-climate-crisis-after-hurricane-helene,Trump continues to deny climate crisis as he visits hurricane-ravaged Georgia,Climate Change,Public Health & Environment,"As research finds that the deadly Hurricane Helene was greatly exacerbated by global warming , Donald Trump is continuing to deny the climate crisis and court donations from the industry most responsible for planetary heating. Environmentalists worry that he will also gut flood protections and climate policy if he wins November’s presidential election. Hours before Helene made landfall in Florida’s Big Bend region Thursday night as a major category 4 hurricane, Trump baselessly said nuclear “warming”, not the climate crisis , is “the warming that you’re going to have to be very careful with”. The following day, he said the “little hurricane” was partially responsible for attendees leaving his rallies early. As the hurricane continued to ravage the region over the weekend, the former president dismissed global warming in a Saturday speech, and the following day referred to the climate crisis as “one of the great scams of all time”. Helene has now killed more than 150 people across the region. On Tuesday in Wisconsin, Trump incorrectly said that under the “green new scam”, Democrats “wanted to rip down all the buildings in Manhattan and they wanted to rebuild them without windows”. No environmental plans included removing windows from buildings, though Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act did include incentives for replacing windows with more energy-efficient models. A preliminary study from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, published on Monday night, found that climate change caused 50% more rainfall during the hurricane in some parts of Georgia and the Carolinas. “It’s obscene that communities … are suffering and dying from the reality of the climate emergency while Donald Trump denies that it even exists,” said Brett Hartl, political director at the environmental non-profit Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund. When Trump visited hurricane-ravaged Georgia on Monday, he said: “We’re here today to stand with complete solidarity with the people of Georgia and all those suffering in the terrible aftermath of Hurricane Helene.” But he is now headed back to the campaign trail to court donations from the fossil fuel industry, which accounts for over 75% of all planet-heating pollution and nearly 90% of all carbon dioxide emissions. On Wednesday, Trump will attend two fundraisers in oil-rich Texas. First, he will hold an invite-only lunch in the Permian Basin , the world’s most productive oilfield. Later, he’ll reportedly hold a Houston cocktail party co-hosted by Jeff Hildebrand, who runs Hilcorp Oil and has been a major donor to Trump since 2017. Last week, Trump’s vice-presidential pick, JD Vance , also attended two fundraisers thrown by oil industry executives in Dallas and Fort Worth, before being forced to cancel two Georgia fundraisers due to the hurricane. The events come months after Trump reportedly offered a brazen “deal” to oil bosses , proposing that they give him $1bn for his White House re-election campaign and vowing that once back in office he would shred dozens of environmental regulations and prevent any new ones, sparking congressional investigations . Trump has also come under fire for his ties to Project 2025 , a wide-ranging policy blueprint from which he has tried to distance himself, but which was written by allies and previous advisers of his. The plan leave US communities with far fewer resources to rebuild after climate disasters. If enacted, the plan would end the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (Fema) federal flood insurance program – the primary source of federal flood insurance across the country – and replace it with private insurance plans “starting with the least risky areas currently identified by the program”. The playbook calls for an end to Fema’s disaster preparedness grants . And it calls to break up and privatize the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The agency should “fully commercialize its forecasting operations and focus on providing data to private companies”, the plan says, referring to forecasts done by the National Weather Service, the country’s main source of weather forecasting which sends out warnings about disasters like Helene. “While roads, bridges and entire towns are being washed away, Trump and Project 2025 plan to gut Fema and roadblock every agency from confronting the climate crisis,” said the Center for Biological Diversity’s Hartl. Project 2025 additionally calls for a “review” of the National Hurricane Center, a division of the National Weather Service which provides warnings, forecasts and analysis on dangerous storms. Data collected by the center should be “presented neutrally, without adjustments intended to support any one side in the climate debate”, the project says. But scientists have long warned that the climate crisis is strongly linked to increased hurricane intensity. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Heritage Foundation, the rightwing thinktank that led Project 2025, said the plan “does not call for the elimination of NOAA, the NWS, or the NHC”. “Rather than ‘cutting’ FEMA, Project 2025 is advocating for a realignment of the agency’s mission and focus – away from DEI and climate change initiatives and restoring it to that of helping people before, during, and after disasters,” the agency said. But the proposal would slash protections for flood-affected communities. And it would also more broadly catalyze a dismantling of climate policy, including efforts to curb planet-heating emissions . “Donald Trump just denied climate change for a week straight, is raising money from big oil billionaires tomorrow, and is planning to gut disaster aid with his Project 2025 agenda next year,” said Pete Jones, rapid response director for the climate-focused advocacy group Climate Power. “When American communities are devastated by extreme weather, Trump’s plan is to increase their suffering while handing out $110bn in tax breaks to big oil.”","Donald Trump continues to deny the climate crisis and court donations from the industry most responsible for planetary heating.

5104,2024-10-03 17:00:27,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/03/flooding-us-cities-2100,How bad will flooding get by 2100? These AI images show US destinations underwater,Climate Change,Public Health & Environment,"F loods affecting much of the south-east US show the destructive force of higher sea levels and warmer temperatures. Now, researchers at the non-profit Climate Central are using artificial intelligence to predict how climate-related flooding will affect US communities into the next 75 years if warming continues at its current pace. Previous research has shown that by 2050, sea levels along the US coastline could rise as much as 12in (30cm) from 2020 levels. High-tide flooding, which can occur even in sunny weather, is projected to triple by 2050, and so-called 100-year floods may soon become annual occurrences in New England. The scale of the threat is difficult to fathom, said Ben Strauss, CEO and chief scientist at Climate Central. He hopes new AI imagery will help. “We want to change how flood risk is communicated in this country,” Strauss said. “When the picture [is] of a local site that you know and are familiar with, that’s when the stakes really make themselves apparent.” Climate Central sent camera-equipped trucks along the eastern and Gulf coasts to capture images and videos of flood-prone areas. Researchers overlaid the images with elevation data to create a real-time flood map that they say paints a clearer picture of current and future flood risks. “Some people use AI to make deepfakes, but we use AI in a very controlled way to illustrate science projects,” said Strauss. “When we take a photograph, we analyze the position and the elevation of every single pixel in that image, and we force the AI to put water only up to the flood level.” Climate Central shared images of iconic vacation destinations along the east coast – including Cape Cod and the Jersey shore – with the Guardian, visualizing how they will be dramatically altered by sea level rise and flooding. The images depict water levels associated with 100-year floods, called that because there is a 1% likelihood of them occurring in a given year. However, these floods are increasing in frequency. Earlier this year, Maine experienced three 100-year-storms in the span of three months. Melting ice caps are the main driver of sea level rise, which has gone up 4in in the last 30 years alone, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “Sea level rise raises the launch pad for coastal floods,” Strauss said. “So 1ft of sea level rise turns a 3ft flood into a 4ft flood. It also makes 3ft floods much more frequent than they used to be.” Researchers used the Interagency Sea Level Task Force’s intermediate predictions for sea level rise, which project a rise of 10 to 12in by 2050 and roughly 3ft by 2100 in the north-east. “Part of the future of sea level rise is all of the ice sheets and glaciers of the world catching up with the amount of warming that we’ve already caused, and a lot of that is what we see by 2050,” Strauss said. “Whereas up to 2100 you see a really big difference, depending on whether we heat up the planet more, or stabilize to near where we are.” Researchers found one of the places that will be most affected by sea-level rise is Cape Cod in Massachusetts. “On the Cape, all of our towns focus on flooding as the biggest risk – everything is at stake,” said Shannon Hulst, a floodplain specialist for Barnstable county in Cape Cod. “We’re both affected by the ocean, and the ocean drives our economy.” An estimated 5.5 million people visit Cape Cod each year, bringing in some $730m to the local economy. But rising waters are eroding the cape’s famous beaches. Hulst said: “If we don’t have beaches that draw in visitors any more, then our economy is going to look very different.” Low-lying coastal areas like Cape Cod are at risk from tides, waves and storm surges. Some are adapting by relocating inland; restoring coastal ecosystems like wetlands, beaches, dunes and oyster beds; elevating buildings and roads; and constructing sea walls. Residents are also flood-proofing their homes by raising their foundations or building on stilts, for example. But while higher elevation can protect a property, that alone is not enough. “Maybe your home won’t get destroyed,” said Nick Angarone, New Jersey’s chief resilience officer. “But if you can’t get out to get food and water, or if you lose power and you can’t get medical assistance and the rescuers can’t get to you, are you really resilient?” Some residents in the flood-prone areas will eventually have little choice but to accept government buyouts of their homes, experts said. Strauss said he hoped imagery like Climate Central’s will get people thinking about local resilience planning and their own emergency preparations. “Even at the level of an inbound hurricane, we think that an image showing how deep the flood waters could be will be much more powerful in persuading people to evacuate and protect their lives than an emergency alert message in all caps,” said Strauss. “If they see that their house would be halfway underwater, that’s a different story.”","Researchers have used artificial intelligence to predict how climate-related flooding will affect US communities into the next 75 years if warming continues at its current pace.

159,2024-09-27 07:00:02,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/26/government-funded-social-network-attacking-pesticide-critics,Revealed: the US government-funded ‘private social network’ attacking pesticide critics,Public Health & Environment,Society & Culture,"I n 2017, two United Nations experts called for a treaty to strictly regulate dangerous pesticides, which they said were a “global human rights concern”, citing scientific research showing pesticides can cause cancers, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s and other health problems. Publicly, the pesticide industry’s lead trade association dubbed the recommendations “ unfounded and sensational assertions ”. In private, industry advocates have gone further. Derogatory profiles of the two UN experts, Hilal Elver and Baskut Tuncak , are hosted on an online private portal for pesticide company employees and a range of influential allies. Members can access a wide range of personal information about hundreds of individuals from around the world deemed a threat to industry interests, including the US food writers Michael Pollan and Mark Bittman, the Indian environmentalist Vandana Shiva and the Nigerian activist Nnimmo Bassey. Many profiles include personal details such as the names of family members, phone numbers, home addresses and even house values. The profiling is part of an effort – that was financed, in part, by US taxpayer dollars – to downplay pesticide dangers, discredit opponents and undermine international policymaking, according to court records, emails and other documents obtained by the non-profit newsroom Lighthouse Reports. It collaborated with the Guardian, the New Lede, Le Monde, Africa Uncensored, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and other international media partners on the publication of this investigation. The efforts were spearheaded by a “reputation management” firm in Missouri called v-Fluence. The company provides services that it describes as “intelligence gathering”, “proprietary data mining” and “risk communications”. The revelations demonstrate how industry advocates have established a “private social network” to counter resistance to pesticides and genetically modified (GM) crops in Africa, Europe and other parts of the world, while also denigrating organic and other alternative farming methods. More than 30 current government officials are on the membership list, most of whom are from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). Elver, who is now a university research professor and a member of a United Nations food security committee , said public money would have been better spent on scientific research into the health impacts of pesticides than on profiling people such as herself. “Instead of understanding the scientific reality, they try and shoot the messenger. It is really hard to believe,” she said. Author Michael Pollan’s profile portrays him as an “ardent opponent” of industrial agriculture and a proponent of organic farming. His profile includes a long list of criticisms and details such as the names of his siblings, parents, son and brother-in-law. “It’s one thing to have an industry come after you after publishing a critical article. This happens all the time in journalism,” Pollan said. “But to have your own government pay for it is outrageous. These are my tax dollars at work.” Records show that Jay Byrne, a former Monsanto executive and founder of v-Fluence, led the effort. Byrne advised US officials and attempted to sabotage opposition to products created by the world’s largest agrochemical companies. He and v-Fluence are named as co-defendants in a case against the Chinese-owned agrochemical firm Syngenta. They are accused of helping Syngenta suppress information about risks that the company’s paraquat weedkillers could cause Parkinson’s disease, and of helping “neutralize” its critics. (Syngenta denies there’s a proven causal link between paraquat and Parkinson’s.) In an emailed statement, Byrne denied the allegations in the lawsuit, citing “numerous incorrect and factually false claims”, made by plaintiffs. When asked about the findings of this investigation, Byrne said that the “claims and questions you have posed are based on grossly misleading representations, factual errors regarding our work and clients, and manufactured falsehoods”. The company sees its role as “an information collection, sharing, analysis, and reporting provider”, Byrne said. He said the profiles were based on publicly available information. “Our scope of work that you are questioning is limited to monitoring, research, and trends reporting on global activities and trends for plant breeding and crop protection issues,” Byrne said in his emailed response. Byrne joined Monsanto in 1997 amid the company’s rollout of GM crops designed to tolerate being sprayed with its glyphosate herbicides. As director of corporate communications, his focus was on gaining acceptance for the controversial “biotech” crops . He previously held various high-level legislative and public affairs positions at the US Agency for International Development (USAid). The founding of v-Fluence in 2001 came amid growing public policy battles over GM crops and pesticides commonly used by farmers and other applicators to kill insects and weeds. Mounting scientific evidence has linked some pesticides to a host of health risks , including leukemia, Parkinson’s, and cancers of the bladder, colon, bone marrow, lung, blood cells and pancreas, as well as reproductive problems, learning disorders and problems of the immune system . The concerns about various documented health impacts have led multiple countries to ban or otherwise restrict several types of pesticides. In a speech Byrne delivered at an agricultural industry conference in 2016, he made his stance clear. He characterized conventional agriculture as being “under attack” from what he called “the protest industry”, and alleged that powerful anti-pesticide, pro-organic forces were spending billions of dollars “creating fears about pesticide use”, GM crops and other industrial agriculture issues. “We’re almost always cast as the villain in these scenarios,” he told conference attendees. “And so we need to flip that around. We need to recast the stories that we tell in alternative ways.” v-Fluence’s early clients included Syngenta and Monsanto. Later, it secured funding from the US government as part of a contract with a third party. Public spending records show the USAid contracted with the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), a non-governmental organization that manages a government initiative to introduce GM crops in African and Asian nations. In turn, IFPRI paid v-Fluence a little more than $400,000 from roughly 2013 through 2019 for services that included counteracting critics of “modern agriculture approaches” in Africa and Asia. v-Fluence was to set up the “private social network portal” that would, among other things, provide “tactical support” for efforts to gain acceptance for the GM crops . The company then launched a platform called Bonus Eventus, named after the Roman god of agriculture whose name translates to “good outcome”. The individuals profiled in the portal include more than 500 environmental advocates, scientists, politicians and others seen as opponents of pesticides and GM crops. USAid did not respond to a request for comment. Details in the profiles appear to be drawn from a range of online sources, and many of them include disparaging allegations authored by people funded by, or otherwise connected to, the chemical industry. Early versions of the profiles were compiled by Academics Review, a non-profit created with the involvement of Monsanto and Byrne . Today Bonus Eventus is invite-only and counts more than 1,000 members. They include executives from the world’s largest agrochemical companies and their lobbyists, as well as academics, government officials and high-profile policymakers such as the Trump administration’s ambassador to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and an agricultural research adviser to USAid. When contacted by reporters, some said they had not signed up to be members of the portal themselves, or were not aware of the content. One said they would cancel their membership. A profile of a London-based research professor who has spoken out against agrochemical companies and GM crops contains several deeply personal details of his life unrelated to his positions on crops or chemicals. The profile describes a wife who died of “suicide-related complications” after discovering an extra-marital affair by her husband and following a “23-year struggle with depression and schizophrenia …” A profile of a prominent US scientist that is laden with critical commentary includes details about a 33-year-old traffic violation and the scientist’s spending on political campaign contributions, along with a personal phone number (that has one digit wrong) and the scientist’s former home address. An Indiana pediatric health researcher who studies pesticide impacts on babies is also profiled. The information lists a home address, along with the property’s approximate value, and the names and other details of his wife and two children. A profile of former New York Times food writer Mark Bittman, a critic of industrial agriculture, is 2,000 words long and includes a description of where he lives, details of two marriages and personal hobbies, and an extensive criticisms section. “It’s filled with mistakes and lies,” Bittman said of the profile about him. Still, he said, the fact that he is profiled is far less of a concern than the larger context in which the profile exists. Bittman said that it was a “terrible thing” for taxpayer dollars to be used to help a PR agency “work against sincere, legitimate and scientific efforts to do agriculture better”. “The fact that for well over a century the government has steadfastly supported industrial agriculture both directly and indirectly, at the expense of agroecology is a direct roadblock in the face of efforts to produce nutritious food that’s universally accessible while minimizing environmental impact. That’s sad, tragic, malicious and wrong.” Both Lighthouse Reports and an author of this article, Carey Gillam, are also profiled on the platform. “Collecting personal information about individuals who oppose the industry goes way beyond regular lobbying efforts,” said Dan Antonowicz, an associate professor at Wilfrid Laurier University in Canada who researches and lectures about corporate conduct. “There is a lot to be concerned about here.” CropLife International, the pre-eminent advocacy group for agricultural pesticides, said it would “be looking into” the issues raised in this piece, after reporters asked about the dozens of CropLife employees around the world who are listed as members of Bonus Eventus. v-Fluence and Byrne personally have developed extensive connections with government officials who he has advised on attempts to introduce pesticides regulations outside the US. In 2018 Byrne attended a meeting with the US trade representative to discuss “concrete and actionable ways to assist” the agency in its pesticide policies. Following the meeting, Byrne was invited to meet with the government’s chief agricultural trade negotiator. Around the same time, Byrne was invited by the USDA to advise an interagency group tasked with limiting international rules that would reduce pesticides. Byrne instructed the group on efforts to enact stricter pesticide regulations, and referred to a “politicized threat” from the “agroecology movement”. A key region for v-Fluence work has been Africa. According to the government contracts, v-Fluence was to work with USAid’s program to elevate pro-GM crop messaging in Africa and counter GM opponents. It focused in particular on Kenya . Byrne denies that v-Fluence has any past or current contracts with the US government. He said the US funds “other organizations with whom we work”, and over more than 20 years “we’ve had multiple projects funded by the US and other governments”. Opposition to GM crops and pesticides has been strong in Kenya, where approximately 40% of the population works in agriculture. Kenyan farm workers use many pesticides that are banned in Europe and are routinely exposed to these products, often without adequate protective equipment or access to healthcare. About 300 African individuals and organizations, mainly in Kenya, are profiled on Bonus Eventus. Bonus Eventus lists more than 30 Kenyan members with access to its private network, more than any other country outside North America. Members from Kenya include a high-ranking official at the ministry of agriculture, livestock and fisheries, and a former chief executive of the National Biosafety Authority. As part of its Kenya campaign, Byrne and v-Fluence were involved in efforts to undermine a conference that was to be held in Nairobi in June 2019, organized by the World Food Preservation Center, an organization which provides education on agricultural technology in developing countries. Scheduled speakers included scientists whose work has exposed the health and environmental impacts of pesticides, and it came as Kenyan lawmakers were about to launch a parliamentary inquiry into hazardous pesticides. Records show that in early February 2019, Byrne sent his weekly newsletter to members of Bonus Eventus. The newsletter warned that speakers of the upcoming conference included “anti-science critics of conventional agriculture”, and that “promotional materials include claims that GMOs and pesticides may cause cancer and other diseases”. The email mentioned the conference’s sponsors and linked to the Bonus Eventus profile of the World Food Preservation Center. The day after he sent the email, prominent members of the Bonus Eventus network took action. Margaret Karembu, an influential Kenyan policymaker and early member of Bonus Eventus, sent an email alert to a group that included agrichemical employees and USDA officials, many of whom were also members of Bonus Eventus. “[The pesticides conference] is a big concern and we need to strategize,” Karembu wrote, starting lengthy discussions about how they could “neutralize the negative messaging” of the conference, as one participant described. Just days later, the organizers of the conference received emails informing them that their funders were pulling out. Dr Martin Fregene, director of agriculture and agro-industry at the African Development Bank (AfDB), wrote to them: “I am afraid the aforementioned conference is one-sided and sends a wrong message about the AfDB’s position on agricultural technologies approved for use by regulatory bodies .” The next week, Byrne sent a news alert to his network telling them AfDB and another sponsor had withdrawn their support of the conference. He later shared the information personally with select employees at USAid and USDA. Byrne said he had no involvement in the loss of funding for the conference. “We had no role in any donor ‘withdrawing’ support of this conference,” he said. Neither USDA nor USAid responded to questions about the conference. A spokesperson for AfDB said that the bank’s senior management had taken the decision to withdraw funding from the conference after they were contacted by Syngenta, which expressed concerns that the conference was “one-sided”. The director of World Food Preservation Centre, Charles Wilson, who is a former research scientist at the USDA said he had felt “unseen forces” operating against the conference, but was surprised to learn the details. “By targeting certain speakers as ‘anti-science’, this firm appears to be borrowing from an old industry playbook – to attempt to squash legitimate areas of scientific inquiry before they take root,” he said. Dr Million Belay, general coordinator of the Ugandan non-profit Alliance for Food Sovereignty in Africa (AFSA), who was scheduled to speak at the conference, said the findings were “deeply concerning”, describing them as a “blatant attempt to silence and discredit movements advocating for Africa’s food sovereignty”. Bonus Eventus has created profiles on both Belay and AFSA. In addition to attempting to undermine the conference, v-Fluence associates and Bonus Eventus members have sought to spread disputed claims about pesticides and attempts to limit their use. In 2020, a petition to ban hazardous pesticides was resubmitted to the Kenyan parliament. At the same time, a stream of articles authored by Bonus Eventus members started circulating about the supposed devastation that the proposed ban would wreak on Kenya’s food security. In February 2020, for instance, James Wachai Njoroge, who is currently listed as senior counsel on v-Fluence’s website, published an article on the European Scientist website with the headline, Europe’s anti-science plague descends on Africa. He argued: “European activists are putting lives at risk in East Africa, turning a plague of insects into a real prospect of widespread famine.” Njoroge’s articles were reposted on several leading climate denial websites, and articles authored by Bonus Eventus members making the same claims were published in US papers including the Wall Street Journal and Town Hall . Hans Dreyer, a former head of crop protection at the Food and Agriculture Organization, said that in his view the Njoroge articles were “utterly biased and highly misleading” and appeared to be attempts to discourage new pesticide regulation. Byrne said Njoroge was not under contract with v-Fluence at the time and that the firm had “never engaged him to produce content, publish articles, or other activities”. The Kenyan parliament ordered several government agencies to conduct a wide-ranging review of the country’s pesticides regulations, but the process stalled. More than 20 pesticides banned in Europe remain common in Kenya. A lawsuit naming Byrne and v-Fluence as co-defendants with Syngenta was filed in Missouri by a woman and her son, Donna and James Evitts, who both suffer from Parkinson’s disease and claim it is linked to decades of use of the herbicide paraquat on their family farm. The suit contains specific allegations about the role of v-Fluence in hiding the dangers of paraquat, which has been banned in the EU, the UK, China and dozens of other countries, though not in the US. There have been several studies linking paraquat to Parkinson’s; one of the most recent was published in February in the peer-reviewed International Journal of Epidemiology . The Evitts lawsuit is one of thousands of cases brought by people alleging they developed Parkinson’s from using Syngenta’s paraquat products. Originally filed in Missouri, the case is pending in the US district court for the southern district of Illinois, where thousands of paraquat cases have been consolidated. The first US paraquat trial is scheduled to get under way in February. Donna’s husband, George Evitts, also had Parkinson’s and died in 2007 at the age of 63. He had sprayed paraquat around his farm from 1971 to shortly before his diagnosis and death, according to the lawsuit. Donna was diagnosed with Parkinson’s two years after her husband died. Their son, who grew up on the farm, was diagnosed with the same disease in 2014. The lawsuit cites sealed court records in alleging that Syngenta signed a contract with v-Fluence in 2002 to help the company deal with negative information coming to light about its paraquat herbicides. The lawsuit alleges v-Fluence went on to help Syngenta create false or misleading online content that was “Paraquat-friendly”, used search engine optimization to suppress negative information about paraquat in internet searches, and investigated the social media pages of victims who reported injuries to Syngenta’s crisis hotline. According to the lawsuit, Byrne traveled to Brussels in September 2003 to meet with Syngenta executives, where they agreed to protect paraquat products from mounting concerns and regulatory actions. The meeting participants agreed to adopt an approach of “defend or be damned”, the lawsuit alleges. One of the alleged v-Fluence jobs was to develop a website called the “Paraquat Information Center” at paraquat.com that carried a reassuring message about the safety of paraquat and asserted there was no valid scientific link between the chemical and Parkinson’s. The site had various featured articles encouraging paraquat use, such as one headlined: Why Africa needs paraquat. The website did not have a Syngenta-branded logo as its other web pages did, and it operated with a domain that was separate from Syngenta. It was only identified as affiliated with Syngenta in a small font at the very bottom of the website. It was not until this year – as litigation against the company accelerated – that Syngenta brought the website under its company web address and added its logo to the top of the page, making it clear the information was coming from Syngenta. In a letter sent by Byrne’s lawyer to Evitts’s lawyers as part of the ongoing litigation, the lawyer confirmed that v-Fluence had done work for Syngenta for more than 20 years, but said: “Syngenta never engaged v-Fluence to perform any work on Paraquat other than to monitor publicly available information, provide benchmark assessments of content and stakeholder sources, and to provide supplemental contextual analysis.” Byrne said he would not respond to questions about the pending litigation, which he broadly characterized as containing “manufactured and false” claims. When asked for comment, Syngenta denied the allegations made in the lawsuit and said scientific studies “do not support the claim of a causal link between exposure to paraquat and the development of Parkinson’s disease”. The company did not answer questions about Bonus Eventus and v-Fluence, saying it would address those claims in court. The New Lede and the Guardian have previously revealed that Syngenta’s internal research found adverse effects of paraquat on brain tissue decades ago but the company withheld that information from regulators, instead working to discredit independent science linking the chemical to brain disease and developing a “ Swat team ” to counter critics. In its response to the stories, Syngenta did not comment on these specific claims. It asserted that no “peer-reviewed scientific publication has established a causal connection between paraquat and Parkinson’s disease”. v-Fluence had new prospects with the US government in the 2020s. In 2020 the USDA contracted with a “strategic communications firm” called White House Writers Group (WHWG) for up to $4.9m. It was part of a USDA strategy to undermine Europe’s Farm to Fork, an environmental policy which aimed to reduce pesticide use by 50% by 2030. v-Fluence was to provide “data” services as part of the WHWG contract, which also included access to Bonus Eventus, according to records obtained from the USDA. Records do not specify how the money was to be divided between the firms. The contract was planned to last until 2025 but public spending reports suggest that only one payment has been made under the contract – for $50,000 to WHWG. The USDA said that it was reviewing the agreement. Clark Judge, managing director of White House Writers Group, said his organization had tried to revive the contract, to no avail. He stated: “Bonus Eventus was, and I presume still is, an online community for scholars, journalists, and the like who share perspectives and information on agricultural topics.” When asked about the findings of this investigation, Byrne said: “There is no unethical, illegal, or otherwise inappropriate outreach, lobbying or related activities by our organization of any kind.” Some experts say they are disturbed by the US government’s association with v-Fluence. “I don’t think most people realize the degree of corporate espionage and USDA’s complicity with it,” said Austin Frerick, who served as co-chair of the Biden campaign’s agriculture antitrust policy committee and recently authored a book about concentration of power in the food system. “The coordination here – the fact that USDA is part of this – is really scary.” Bonus Eventus has been active in recent days. Five days before this story was published, after reporters asked Byrne and others for comment, the Bonus Eventus portal alerted members to the upcoming investigative reporting project. They provided members with an article describing the project as “an ethical trainwreck with no concept of journalistic integrity”.","Two UN experts called for a treaty to strictly regulate dangerous pesticides. Derogatory profiles of the two UN experts, Hilal Elver and Baskut Tuncak, are hosted on an online private portal for pesticide company employees and influential allies. Members can access a wide range of personal information about hundreds of individuals from around the world deemed a threat to industry interests. Many profiles include personal details such as the names of family members, phone numbers, home addresses and even house values. The profiling is part of an effort – that was financed, in part, by US taxpayer dollars.",http://res.cloudinary.com/drwsupfyj/image/upload/v1728703880/state-of-the-earth/news_photographs/revealedtheusgovernmentfundedprivatesocialnetworkattackingpesticidecritics.jpg
287,2024-09-25 14:00:04,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/25/utilities-cut-power-electricity-during-heatwaves,93F and no electricity: why some US utilities can cut power despite heatwaves,Public Health & Environment,Sustainability,"M ichael Crowley runs his air conditioner nonstop on hot summer days to keep his cat, Arya, comfortable. But when the Richmond, Virginia, chef got home after work on 7 August 2022, it “felt like 100 degrees”. His power was out. He phoned his leasing office and was told his electricity bill was unpaid. Crowley protested, saying his utilities had long been covered by his rent check. But then he learned his building’s new property manager required tenants to pay for power separately – something Crowley said was unclear. No one told him about the delinquent bill, he said. His power remained shut off for three days as the mercury climbed to 93F (34C). The battery-operated fans he bought were no match for the oppressive heat. He filled Arya’s bowl with cool water, but she seemed “a little scared”. He, too, worried that she would get sick. “I was freaking out,” he said. “What was I supposed to do?” Summer electricity disconnections can be not only anxiety-producing but also dangerous. Last summer, one Arizona woman died after her power was cut over a $51 debt. Today, Crowley’s shutoff would be illegal. Amid record heat this June, Virginia banned utility companies from disconnecting services when temperatures reach 92F or higher. But in 27 states, utilities can still disconnect power for non-payment on the hottest days. That includes some of the hottest US states, such as Hawaii and Florida, as well as many that ban shutoffs in the extreme cold. It’s an issue that can have deadly consequences, said Selah Goodson Bell, a campaigner at the national environmental group Center for Biological Diversity. Each year, heatwaves kill more people than any other form of extreme weather. “Summers are getting hotter everywhere and this year will likely be the hottest year in world history,” he said. “States are starting to react and do more to protect [utility] customers. But it’s not nearly enough.” It’s difficult to know the national scope of the issue, as utilities in 22 states are not currently required to provide data on shutoffs. This makes it “impossible for policymakers to know which communities are affected and how”, said Goodson Bell. Some utilities collect data on shutoffs, but only 10% publicly release that information, said Sanya Carley, who co-directs the Energy Justice Lab at Indiana University. “The lack of data transparency is a major problem,” said Carley, who is also an energy policy expert at the University of Pennsylvania. The available numbers show a troubling trend. According to the Energy Justice Lab’s disconnection tracker, energy utility providers in 2022 shut off power to at least 3 million customers over missed bill payments, and more than 30% of those events happened during summer months. A separate 2023 analysis from the Center for Biological Diversity and the utility watchdog Energy and Policy Institute found that in the first 10 months of 2022, households had their electric power shut off for non-payment more than 1.5m times and their gas shut off 380,000 times, representing a 29% and 76% increase respectively over the previous year. And that’s just in the 30 states on which the researchers could obtain shutoff data. “More people are more concerned about extreme weather dangers,” said Shelby Green, research fellow at Energy and Policy Institute who has spent years fighting utility disconnections. “But in some ways, things might be moving in the wrong direction.” One likely reason for the uptick: rising costs. Monthly electricity bills were on average 2% higher each month in 2021 compared with 2022. Costs appear to have risen even more rapidly this year. One report from the policy organizations the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (Neada) and Center for Energy Poverty and Climate (CEPC) forecast an 8% rise in summer electric bills in 2024 over 2023. The costs of other consumer goods such as groceries have steadily risen across the same time period, meaning some customers are choosing between food and electricity. At the same time, Congress this year cut funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program by one-third, leading some states to slash utility aid to low-income households. States tend to deplete 80% of the available program funds as bills rise in the winter cold, leaving only 20% for cooling aid in the summer. That’s especially dangerous for low-income Americans who tend to live in poorly insulated homes, which are more expensive to keep at comfortable temperatures. Robin Line, a 65-year-old resident of south central Los Angeles, knows this first-hand. She said the windows in her low-income building are not sealed off, allowing precious cool air to seep through the cracks. “You can see a half-inch [on the side of] the doors,” she said. “They’re not sealed, they don’t do maintenance, and it’s definitely not weatherized.” In 2023, one in three households cut back on basic needs like medicine or food to afford at least one month’s energy bill, the Neada and CEPC report found. It’s a problem that’s familiar to Line. “You have to shop with only money in mind,” she said. “And you can’t get all the food you want or need every week.” Though she’s had unpaid bills, Line has “not yet” experienced a shutoff – something she attributes to her constant calls to officials: “I‘ve begged, pleaded and borrowed.” But officials don’t make it easy to contact them or access aid, she said. “It’s really frustrating,” she said. Existing summer shutoff protections are often also inadequate, environmental advocates argue. In Arizona, the state with the highest heat casualties each year, privately owned utilities are banned from disconnecting households for overdue bills, but cooperatively and publicly owned utilities are excluded from the moratorium. In Nevada, protections are only triggered when temperatures reach 105F. And in Florida, which has no temperature-based utility disconnection bans, the city of Tallahassee has enshrined protections, which are only triggered when temperatures top 100F for eight hours straight. “That just means the policy has literally never been enacted,” said Green, a Tallahassee resident. Some states and utilities suspend disconnections only when the National Weather Service issues an excessive heat warning. But research shows exposure to lower levels of heat can also be dangerous, especially over the course of many hours. Other utilities impose their own shutoff moratoria from 15 June to 1 October. But that can leave residents vulnerable on unseasonably warm days. “We’re finding that extreme weather is a year-round thing now,” said Carley, adding that ultimately, states should have both forms of shutoff protections. Across the country, advocates are working to expand summer shutoff protections. In some places, they’re winning. Maine, like Virginia, this year passed a law preventing shutoffs for non-payment during extreme heat events. Chicago this year banned shutoffs for non-payment when the National Weather Service forecasts temperatures hitting 90F, down from an earlier threshold of 95F. Efforts to improve transparency are also under way. The federal Energy Information Administration is currently reviewing public comments on a federal utility shutoff survey. If their plan is successful, the agency will require all investor-owned gas and electric utilities in the country to report disconnection data on a monthly basis, with the rollout beginning in spring 2025. Some advocates are calling on the agency to strengthen the survey by collecting additional information about households experiencing shutoffs, including zip codes, to see who is worst affected. Victor Sanchez, executive director of the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy, which in 2022 successfully pressured the Los Angeles department of water and power to prohibit disconnections for nonpayment, said that ultimately, “there needs to be more permanent solutions” to protect people from shutoffs. “The question is, what are we doing beyond just extreme weather,” he said. “Access to water and power is not just something that should be preserved during extreme weather events. It should be preserved year-round.” Sign up to Down to Earth","Last summer, one Arizona woman died after her power was cut over a $51 debt.

415,2024-10-04 16:00:05,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/04/sustainable-food-brands,‘VCs need their money back’: why sustainable startups struggle to fix our broken food system,Sustainability,Business & Innovation,"When Andrew Carter and Adam DeMartino started their business Smallhold in 2017, they set out with a simple vision they thought could have a big impact: feed people mushrooms. “Mushrooms are one of the most sustainable calories on the planet, in every aspect,” Carter said, whether you’re looking at water, waste, plastic use or greenhouse gas emissions. “We just wanted to get more people eating them.” For the better part of seven years, Smallhold successfully did just that, getting specialty mushrooms such as shiitake, blue oyster and trumpets into grocery stores and on to Americans’ plates. And they built a cult favorite brand while doing so – a feat made notable by how much harder it is to accomplish with produce than, say, processed snack foods. (Think about how differently you shop for chips or ice-cream, on the lookout for a specific brand you like, versus peaches or tomatoes, the brand of which you may not even notice.) As mushrooms became emblematic of a new vision of sustainability at the start of the pandemic lockdowns, achieving zeitgeist-y star status, Smallhold found itself both riding that wave and helping propel it, earning a range of buzzy media coverage and being valued at $90m at its peak. Just six years after starting in a shipping container in Brooklyn , the brand had built out farms in New York, Texas and California, and had begun selling in 1,400 stores across the country, including Whole Foods. “We gave others hope that a sustainable business could rise quickly, become popular, and change an entire category for the better,” said DeMartino. Smallhold was just one of a host of food startups that have cropped up with the promise that they’re growing food more sustainably or reducing waste . So it came as a disappointing shock to many when the founders both stepped down this spring and Smallhold announced that it was filing for bankruptcy shortly thereafter. Though the company was taken over by investors who restructured and brought the company out of bankruptcy at the end of August, Smallhold emerged as a “shadow” of the company DeMartino once envisioned; it shut down its farms and laid off much of its staff without severance, to the dismay of the founders and customers who had come to associate the brand with the ethical treatment of its employees and farmers as well as the earth. (The brand’s current leadership declined to comment for this article.) What does the brand’s trajectory mean for the prospects of using entrepreneurship to right traditional agriculture’s wrongs? In the example of Smallhold and other produce-focused startups like it, there are lessons to be learned about what role business can – and can’t – play in fixing our food system. Elly Truesdell was working at Whole Foods as a “forager” who helped the grocery chain identify new local suppliers when Smallhold started out, and she remembers being impressed at their unique offering. Where most shoppers had only encountered the most common varieties of button mushrooms, Smallhold was introducing varieties with more interesting and varied flavor profiles, such as lion’s mane and blue oyster. “I traveled the country and visited a ton of local food stores and other grocers and very, very rarely could you see specialty mushrooms of the varieties that they were growing in grocery stores,” she said. That’s some of what convinced her, once she left Whole Foods to get into venture capital with a focus on food businesses, to invest in Smallhold. For a world increasingly thinking about both personal and planetary health, mushrooms hold great appeal as an easy and nutritious meat alternative. And Smallhold was paying farmers a living wage to grow them on waste material, using minimal water and electricity, composting the leftover materials after, and selling their product in compostable retail packaging (an industry first). But startups that gain a foothold in the produce aisle have to offer customers more than that to succeed, Truesdell said. “You cannot hang your hat on sustainability only. Product quality, cost – all of the things that matter in a typical food business still matter.” In some ways, Smallhold excelled at that: in addition to the unique flavor and high quality of its produce, it also built a strong brand through a combination of the charming aesthetics of the mushrooms themselves, a witty social media presence and the relationships its founders built with tastemakers who helped cement Smallhold as part of the zeitgeist. Smallhold isn’t the only produce company that has benefited from creating a unique visual identity. Bowery Farming , an indoor agriculture company that sells greens and berries, and Gotham Greens , which sells salad greens, dressings and herbs, are two others that have invested in top-notch design and branding. While all three companies have claimed to be growing food more sustainably than peer companies in their categories, their unique approach to branding produce is part of what lures in new customers, Truesdell noted. Entrepreneurs who want their business to be sustainable by environmental standards have to also be sustainable in the financial sense of the word. Though what Smallhold set out to do was sell mushrooms that would help people “reconnect with their food, environment, and farmers”, the technology it was using to do so was often what excited funders. “Over time, we were really leading with that,” said DeMartino. “The pitch got crafted around technology further and further.” He often felt that they were adding tech that was cool, but overcomplicated things: “You don’t need to press a button to open a window. You can just open the window,” he said. Plus, creating and maintaining the technology infrastructure was expensive, which made building new farms costly. That in turn made becoming profitable more difficult to do – and when venture capitalists are looking for a return on their investment quickly, a slow path to profitability can be a death knell. “VCs need their money back,” said Ari Greensburg, professor of entrepreneurship and management at NYU Stern. “They need you to get there by five, six years, seven maximum ... If you can’t do that, they abandon you.” That is, in some sense, what happened to Smallhold: after years of ample VC funding, investors decided they weren’t making enough progress toward profitability, stopped cutting them checks, and the company was left without adequate cashflow. Smallhold wasn’t the only buzzy produce company to go bankrupt under these circumstances. AeroFarms and AppHarvest, two other indoor farming companies that had attracted big venture capital investments in the past, also declared bankruptcy last year when the VC landscape began to shift away from its former optimism about tech-based food startups. It’s easy to tell an entrepreneur that it’s dangerous to take on VC funding, but often harder to offer viable alternatives for startups that need cash. But those options do exist, insisted Truesdell, especially for agriculture companies. She pointed to Ark Foods , a produce startup founded in 2013 that helped create the US market for shishito peppers, as an example. Though the company has taken on some modest equity investments from funds including Truesdell’s, those haven’t made up the bulk of the company’s funding. “They rely a ton on farm credit and on loans from the Farm Bureau, rather than on venture dollars,” she said. “They’re almost always hovering at break-even or slightly profitable, so that they’re not in this difficult situation that companies like Smallhold found themselves in.” She named the family-owned salad and greens business Taylor Farms , which has opted to grow slowly over time rather than taking on big investments in the hopes of scaling up quickly, as another example of how to do things differently. There’s no one-size-fits-all way to build or run a produce startup to ensure that it’ll be around in the long run, and the most effective strategy for changing the food system for the better won’t rely on entrepreneurship alone, but will incorporate policy change and regulation, too. But there are a few lessons worth trying to take away from the successes and failures of the startups that have tried to do so in the last few years: build a strong brand, even in a category like produce that hasn’t historically been known for branding. Offer sustainability, but pair that with other values, such as new flavors or higher quality to lure in customers. And take financial responsibility just as seriously as planetary and social responsibility. “No matter how much you love it, this business runs on money, not on love,” DeMartino said. “We needed to make really key decisions around that in order to sustain the vision of a circular economy business.” Lastly, learn to define success on your own terms. Despite its eventual bankruptcy, Smallhold did help carve out a market across the nation for specialty mushrooms – and getting more people hooked on what could be the “most sustainable calories on the planet” is a legacy the company’s founders think is worth celebrating.","Mushrooms are one of the most sustainable calories on the planet, in every aspect.

543,2024-10-03 18:00:32,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/03/haitian-farm-workers-north-carolina,‘We need ’em worse than they need us’: how Haitian workers feed the US,Agriculture & Food,Public Health & Environment,"O n a foggy morning in June 2021, I left my Durham, North Carolina, home to travel two and a half hours to rural Whiteville, North Carolina, population 5,000-ish. I headed there to meet some of the town’s newest, albeit temporary, residents: 200 Haitian migrants employed as blueberry pickers. These farm workers put food on our tables – and on family tables back in Haiti. But they’re a less visible work force in our food supply chain, toiling largely out of sight on farms in places like Columbus county, with its miles of fields. They are doubly invisible among US guest workers, who overwhelmingly hail from Mexico. But Haitian migrants also come to the US and locations across the hemisphere to work in food production or other service industries. Their numbers have increased after the devastating 2010 earthquake , and many have been able to use temporary protected status (TPS) to stay and work in the US due to conditions that make it hard to return home. Others brave unsafe border crossings into the Dominican Republic’s sugarcane fields for abusively low wages. Some board rickety boats to voyage into Turks and Caicos’s shark-filled waters to serve tourists in luxury resorts. Many endure human trafficking into Maryland to pick tomatoes or risk getting whipped by border patrol agents as they walk across the arid US-Mexico border. And as anthropologists Vincent Joos and Laura Wagner once pointed out, there’s a good chance your Thanksgiving turkey was processed by Haitian workers in North Carolina. During the pandemic’s peak, I volunteered to do Kreyòl translation so the Whiteville workers could get what was then a scarce commodity, the Covid vaccine. Because non-Spanish-speaking migrant farm workers were often an afterthought (then and now), there were few Covid-specific health resources in the Kreyòl language Haitians speak. I’m a scholar of Haitian migration, and much of my writing and research is inspired by my own family history. My paternal grandmother arrived in the US in 1963, and my father joined her in New York a few years later. I grew up knowing about urban Haitian enclaves all over the US, from Queens to Miami’s Little Haiti. However, few people have documented or even know about Haitian life in the rural US, especially in the south. Acting as an intermediary between English-speaking nurses and the Haitian migrants, I saw a different part of the Haitian diaspora in small-town America. By now, most of us have heard that thousands of Haitians have migrated to Springfield, Ohio, to escape volatility at home. In Springfield, they boosted an ailing midwestern factory sector only to become targets of racist rhetoric from the Trump-Vance ticket and others. It’s become popular to spread false narratives about Haitians, to deride our community as one of criminals and resource vampires. Those unfair charges ignore the history of how western powers plundered Haiti, undermined its existence and fostered systemic crisis. Haiti’s role in world food systems dates to the 1700s when French colonizers called it the “Pearl of the Antilles”. During the transatlantic slave trade, it ranked among the world’s top sugar and coffee producers. When the Haitian Revolution brought the end of slavery on the island and its leaders declared their independence, Napoleon Bonaparte obsessed over the loss of his empire’s crown jewel. France later forced the young country to reimburse former enslavers for losing their once-captive workforce – an indemnity of 150m francs with added interest over time. For decades, the US and other countries refused to recognize Haiti, the world’s first independent Black nation. And we wonder why Haiti is the poorest country in the hemisphere, after centuries of extraction, a Wall Street-fomented US occupation and a succession of coup d’états. The workers I met in Whiteville were far from “takers” or “illegals”. They held H-2A visas that permit approved businesses to hire foreign labor when US workers aren’t available or interested in open jobs. Bruce McLean Jr, an extension agent in Columbus county, believes that anywhere from 20% to 25% of all blueberry pickers in south-eastern North Carolina are Haitian. The Whiteville Haitians picked blueberries by hand from mid-June to August. Blueberry pickers often make money by the bucket or box; according to the US Department of Labor, the going wage should be 50 cents a pound for seasonal labor , assuming workers actually make that. In October 2023, the labor department fined a Sampson county, North Carolina, farm contractor for stiffing blueberry workers out of their last weeks of wages, taking their passports and even charging them fees to work in the H-2A program. The six-week season is intense, with long workdays in blistering heat and rain. Beyond the general physical exertion and working in an unfamiliar place, workers are also exposed to pesticides that linger on the berries or soil. They are sometimes shuttled from farm to farm because it’s “always blueberry season somewhere” . This group of workers would be moving in 10 days, and that made it all the more important to vaccinate them before their next stop. At Covid’s height, their very status as farm workers put them at high risk. I understood this instantly when I knocked on doors to find a bathroom. One woman allowed me in, and I saw substandard housing in a mildewy old motel. Although the group in Whiteville was working in the open air, they shared cramped housing without appropriate safety measures. Days or weeks of lodging in a room with four twin beds and one shower made privacy and social distancing impossible. But there was no time to be sick. Relatives back home – in places like L’Estère, known for its luscious rice fields, or La Gonâve island north-west of Port-au-Prince – were sending frequent WhatsApp messages asking for financial help. Cellphones are a lifeline for these workers, connecting them to family or online church services. The likelihood of attending Sunday mass locally was slim without their own transportation. And when you’re a migrant berry picker, there’s almost always more work to do. Seventy miles away, Haitian labor flocked to Mount Olive, an agricultural town known for its pickle company of the same name (and also being the site of a long struggle to organize farm workers for better conditions). There are no good estimates of how many Haitians have come to Mount Olive. Advocates usually say that about 3,000 to 4,000 Haitians arrived after 2010. Pastor Occene Louis of the First Haitian Baptist church thinks that as many as 10,000 have passed through Mount Olive, coming from Brazil or Chile and then moving to other North Carolina cities. A large enough number stayed in Mount Olive that he said the town doesn’t have enough housing; he knows of households with a dozen residents. Perhaps the US census sheds the best, though still imperfect, light on Mount Olive migration patterns. In 2000, Black residents of Mount Olive made up 12% of the population. Twenty years later, they constituted 49%. The town’s now-deceased longtime mayor, Ray McDonald, acknowledged the essential role that Haitians play in the local economy in the film Home Away from Haiti. He said: “We need ’em worse than they need us, as most of the locals will simply not do that work. It is very hard work. It is dirty work. Again, if they went away, a lot of our major production facilities would have to struggle.” In poultry processing, Haitians drive delivery trucks, butcher carcasses and trim skin from the meat. It’s not only dirty work; it’s dangerous. A town resident told me one laborer lost his hand. This “ beneficial Haitian invasion ” met with various responses. Some longstanding residents were “ big-hearted” and welcoming . Others sold their homes and left. Former resident Paulette Bekolo lived in Mount Olive for several years starting in 2011 and saw the growing pains. She found herself advocating for basic rights for Haitian and other workers. Bekolo met with some poultry plants’ human resources departments because “the working conditions were awful. Some of them were denied basic toilet breaks. They were humiliated peeing on them[selves].” She organized classes in English as a second language, first aid and immigrant rights to help her compatriots fit in. Haitians have left an undeniable mark on the town. Haitian supermarkets have popped up and sell lalo (jute leaves) for stew. While attending a church service was largely out of reach for the Whiteville seasonal workers, Mount Olive’s more established community has seven churches vying for their attendance and souls. Some offer services and Bible study in Kreyòl. In Whiteville, the only business near the moldy motel where Haitians resided was a farm advertising its strawberries, likely picked by other migrants. Women cooked over open fires in a parking lot – a sign of just how transient this migrant community was. The chef there asked me, “ Cherie, ki sa ou vle? ” (Honey, what do you want?) as she grabbed the vegetable oil. In Mount Olive, I was served a kitchen-prepared plate of macaroni, rice, beans and meat, and was invited to sit with church congregants. The smells of simmering onions and vegetables in both towns reminded me of my grandmother’s food. I was at home in another part of the country, being fed by Haitian women who help feed us all.","Haitian migrants come to the US and locations across the hemisphere to work in food production or other service industries. Their numbers have increased after the devastating 2010 earthquake, and many have been able to use temporary protected status (TPS) to stay and work in the US. It’s become popular to spread false narratives about Haitians, to deride our community as one of criminals and resource vampires. Those unfair charges ignore the history of how western powers plundered Haiti, undermined its existence and fostered systemic crisis.",http://res.cloudinary.com/drwsupfyj/image/upload/v1728703895/state-of-the-earth/news_photographs/weneedemworsethantheyneedushowhaitianworkersfeedtheus.jpg
671,2024-10-02 17:00:32,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/02/h2a-worker-program-migrant-farm-food,"US farms are forcing workers to buy inedible, expensive meals: ‘It makes you feel enslaved’",Public Health & Environment,Society & Culture,"O n an August afternoon, Pablo stared down at a foam plate sloshing with flavorless pinto beans and a particularly bad version of huevos a la Mexicana. The simple, usually delicious scramble of eggs, tomatoes, onions and jalapeños is difficult to mess up. But if anyone can find a way to make it unpalatable, it’s the cook at his labor camp. Soupy eggs are the last thing the 42-year-old from western Mexico wants to eat. But after a 12-hour day harvesting tobacco in the brutal and sometimes deadly summer heat , he must eat – and this was far from the worst meal he’s been given. A few weeks ago, fellow farm workers got sick due to raw and moldy food they were forced to purchase. On days like this, Pablo can’t decide which is worse: that he’s forced to pay $80 a week for this slop, or that everything about what he eats, when he eats and how much he eats is tightly controlled by his employer. Pablo, who is using a pseudonym due to fear of retaliation, is one of more than 35,000 migrant workers in North Carolina this year as part of the H-2A Temporary Agricultural Worker Program, a guest visa program overseen by the US Department of Labor (DoL). The program enables American employers to hire foreign workers to perform seasonal agricultural work. Employers in the program frequently exploit their migrant employees, and the structure of the program makes easy work of it. Visas are tied to a single employer who must also provide housing, transportation and access to food, creating a crushing power imbalance between American employers and migrant H-2A workers. H-2A regulations require that all conditions of an agricultural job are disclosed in the application for temporary labor certification. On their face, regulations related to food and kitchen access are very precise. For example, labor camp stoves must have a certain number of burners depending on the number of workers, and each individual is only allotted three-fourths of a cubic foot of refrigerator space, about the size of a gallon of milk. The contract entered into between the employer and worker must also detail whether the employer will provide workers access to kitchen facilities, or if the employer will provide three meals a day for no more than $15.88 a day. But sometimes H-2A workers sign contracts with guaranteed kitchen access, only to arrive and learn their employer has what advocates call a “forced meal plan”, unlawfully siphoning money from farm workers’ paychecks. The H-2A program is so rife with serious legal violations that attorney Caitlin Ryland with the farmworker unit of Legal Aid of North Carolina (Lanc) says forced meal plans are often overlooked – even as they become more common. “We’re seeing more cases where individuals or companies see meals as another opportunity to make an extra buck off of a vulnerable workforce that really doesn’t have much of a choice,” she said. Forced meal plans are happening so frequently that a few years ago, Lanc developed materials to inform H-2A workers of their meal plan rights. Pablo has encountered forced meal plans several times during the 14 years he’s come to North Carolina as part of the H-2A program. He is contracted through the North Carolina Growers Association (NCGA), which serves as his joint employer along with the farm or business where he harvests sweet potatoes, tobacco and a variety of other crops. The NCGA serves as an agricultural intermediary, applying en masse for H-2A visas needed by member businesses and then busing workers like Pablo across the border and moving them from farm to farm as needed. While American employers can obtain workers from 86 countries , 90% come from Mexico and a majority work in Florida, California, Georgia, Washington and North Carolina, where the NCGA obtains the largest proportion of H-2A workers in the state. Workers who come to the US through a contract with the NCGA are rolling the dice with their food, according to advocates. The growers association’s contracts cover many employers and the language regarding food is often vague, leaving workers unsure of the shape their meals will take until they’re in the US. And because they have no control over the farms they’re sent to, they can gain and lose kitchen access multiple times during a single season. The NCGA did not respond to multiple requests for comment. According to Carol Brooke, a senior attorney with the North Carolina Justice Center’s Workers’ Rights Project, forced meal plans are common in North Carolina. In fact, the organization is currently handling a meal plan-related legal case. The pending lawsuit alleges that eastern North Carolina agricultural operations Boykin Farms, Rhodes Farming, and Lee and Sons Farms were contractually obligated to provide kitchen access to workers. However, over the course of four years beginning in 2019, employers allegedly blocked H-2A workers from accessing cooking spaces and instead charged them as much as $160 a week under a forced meal plan. According to the complaint, meals were reportedly only provided twice a day Monday through Saturday. The meager breakfast consisted of coffee and slices of bread. In another example, workers arrived at a labor camp after a long day of work only to “find their dinners left out for them, cold and covered in flies”. Some forced meal plans are also unlawful because they charge workers prices that far exceed the daily cost allowed by DoL. The most expensive forced meal plan that attorney Aaron Jacobson has ever encountered was around $150 to $200 a week, almost half of workers’ paychecks. Jacobson is a supervising attorney with Lanc’s farmworker unit, where he has litigated cases related to forced meal plans going back to 2018. He noted that nothing about these forced meal plans is “optional” or “voluntary”. Workers have to pay for the meal plan even if they don’t eat the food – and it’s often a hard violation to prove because most employers know better than to leave a paper trail. Jacobson says that typically, when H-2A workers are taken to cash their checks, their employers then immediately demand a kickback: cash for the plan. Ryland has represented workers in more extreme cases. In one, an employer told workers that they would have to pay a fee if they wanted to leave their labor camp, and the employer also locked them out of the labor camp kitchen and threatened to shoot workers who fled without first paying their debts. The workers who remained were forced to pay exorbitant amounts for meager, poor-quality food. Unable to go to the grocery store or use the labor camp kitchen, hungry farmworkers built a makeshift grill with cinder blocks and an oven rack to grill fish they caught in a nearby swamp. These conditions aren’t as uncommon as you’d think, said Leticia Zavala, a former farm worker who now organizes North Carolina H-2A workers with the worker-led organization El Futuro Es Nuestro. Workers often report barred kitchens and chained refrigerators, she said. Zavala’s outreach efforts put her in touch with Felipe, who’s worked in the H-2A program for nine years. He’s also using a pseudonym due to a well-founded fear of retaliation. In his experience, refusal to comply with a forced meal plan often comes with intimidation – or worse. “A few years ago, nine of us [workers] refused to sign the forced meal plan contract,” Felipe said. “The manager told us: ‘You’re no longer working here. Get your stuff ready because the [NCGA] is going to pick you up.’” With Zavala’s help, Felipe and other workers were transferred to another farm. The incident occurred in 2020, when DoL’s current maximum daily charge for a meal plan was $12.67. In their complaint, Felipe and his co-workers noted they were paying up to $20.85 a day, which included out-of-pocket costs for food on Sundays when their employer didn’t provide meals. Felipe says all he wants is “dignified food”, something that’s been hard to come by in the US. With Zavala’s help, Pablo has also recently filed complaints demanding kitchen access. This led to his termination and transfer to two different farms. At his current farm, he’s on yet another forced meal plan. Breakfast is typically some bread or a bowl of cereal. By 9am, he’s usually hungry again, but he must wait until noon for lunch. Most days it’s a plate of beans and rice, a few tortillas and very little protein. Pablo sent the Guardian cellphone images of recent meals, including a “soup” made of beans and hot dogs and various iterations of potatoes cooked in a watery salsa with bits of bacon or diced hot dogs. The 2022 H-2A Modernization Rule clarified that employers that elect to provide meals to H-2A workers must ensure the meals are calorically and nutritionally adequate. To meet the requirement, US DoL encourages employers to consult caloric intake guidelines from the United States Department of Agriculture and the National Institutes of Health. But fresh fruit and vegetables are almost never offered as part of a meal plan of any kind – an irony, given how much time workers spend each day harvesting these very items. The cheap, starchy, carb-loaded and heavily processed foods served in forced meal plans can have health consequences. Sara Quandt is a biological anthropologist with expertise in human nutrition. The professor emerita of epidemiology and prevention at North Carolina’s Wake Forest University School of Medicine has conducted research with farmworker communities for more than 30 years. According to Quandt, if workers aren’t consuming enough calories to sustain the difficult physical labor they perform, their bodies first eat through their fat reserves and then their muscles are used by their bodies as fuel. The cyclical nature of farm worker diets is akin to the impact of yo-yo diets, in which dieters are often losing and regaining the same few pounds but never recovering muscle lost during the process. The consequences can be even more severe for those with chronic conditions. Pablo currently shares housing with a few men who have diabetes. He says that the workers try to look out for each other’s health by sharing food or otherwise encouraging men with chronic illnesses to avoid foods that will make them feel unwell. Pablo said: “Some people need certain food or food at certain times, or they lose the energy to work. But the field manager will keep demanding them to keep working.” That’s a recipe for disaster, according to Quandt. “If somebody passes out from low blood sugar, it’s not going to look any different to their co-workers or supervisor than if they passed out because of the heat. So taking them to a cooler area and having them drink water isn’t going to make a difference; they need a sugary drink and treatment,” she said. A spokesperson for NCDoL said that while the agency is “sympathetic” to these situations, NCDoL “has no enforcement authority over the type of food provided to migrant workers”. North Carolina’s Migrant Housing Act does require certified housing for H-2A workers to have a working stove, refrigerator and a sink with hot and cold water, which means workers like Pablo and Felipe who have been locked out of kitchen facilities can file complaints. However, “anything related to meal plans should be referred to US DoL’s wage and hour division”, the state agency said. A representative for the DoL said that when employers fail to comply with the H-2A program’s meal requirements, the agency’s Wage and Hour Division will assess back wages and penalties and where warranted, “seek debarment and/or revocation” of an employer’s H-2A certification. “We take seriously the requirements for H-2A employers to provide meals or furnish free and convenient cooking and kitchen facilities to workers,” a DoL spokesperson said in a statement. “These obligations are critical worker protections, especially for H-2A workers who often live and work in remote areas. We know that every day, across America, H-2A farm workers labor long hours to grow and harvest the crops that place food on the table for our nation. As they do so, it is vital that they have adequate nutrition to stay healthy during their temporary work period.” Workers like Pablo have paid the price for filing complaints with state and federal agencies. “Every farm threatens you if you don’t sign the food contract and then if you don’t sign it, there’s nowhere else to eat and you get fired,” Pablo explains. “It’s now been four different times that I have registered complaints and got fired … I will continue making complaints because we have rights. But every time I get fired, I have to start again from zero.” Forced meal plans are not unique to North Carolina. At a recent event, Zavala learned from religious leaders in the midwest that some H-2A employers are charging workers $44 a day for meals. Solimar Mercado-Spencer, attorney and director of the farmworker rights division of the Georgia Legal Services Program, regularly hears of forced meal plans in her state. Ryland, one of the Lanc lawyers, sees “a real shift in that it’s not even about making money off the farm work anymore; it’s about making money off of the person”, she says. “So it’s charging workers for the opportunity to come to the United States, it’s charging them higher rates for the visa and then charging them for the food. It’s really about making a profit off of the workers’ isolation, as opposed to making a profit off of the farm work.” The many issues around food access inside the H-2A program force workers to develop inventive, and sometimes costly workarounds. Some plant gardens outside their labor camp. Others purchase outdoor grills and mini refrigerators. Last growing season, Felipe bought a car that he stores in North Carolina when he returns home to Mexico. It was a major expense but was worth it. Employers usually only provide transportation to the grocery store on Sundays. Now, Felipe doesn’t have to rely on his employer to get around. It’s one way that Felipe can circumvent a system that undermines workers’ freedom and bodily autonomy. Zavala, the farmworker organizer, said: “A forced meal plan is a very obvious form of control and manipulation. It has to do with your wages, it has to do with your health, it has to do with your liberty to make decisions on a daily basis.” Pablo said these conditions are beyond demoralizing. “It makes you feel enslaved, like you’re a prisoner,” he said. “It’s like you’re not important to anybody.” During his earlier years in the H-2A program, he was unwilling to risk losing work in the US by fighting unjust conditions. That man doesn’t exist anymore, in part due to Zavala, who has taught him how to make the most of the protections offered to H-2A workers. “Our families have lots of dreams and hopes for us, but some people die in the process of working in the United States,” Pablo said. “When we’re this far away from home, we have to do more than just hope we can make it back alive. We have to raise our voices.”","More than 35,000 migrant workers in North Carolina this year as part of the H-2A Temporary Agricultural Worker Program.

799,2024-10-02 14:00:27,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/02/farm-migrant-labor-japanese-american-incarceration-idaho,Something about the migrant labor camp spooked my mother. Then she learned its dark history,Society & Culture,Public Health & Environment,"M y mother, Nora Zavala Gallion, was 11 years old when she first set foot inside the farm labor camp in Caldwell, Idaho . It was 1968, and her family had traveled over 2,000 miles (3,218km) by car from Texas’s Rio Grande valley to harvest sugar beets as migrant laborers. While my family had worked numerous crops across the country for decades, the girl who would become my mother sensed something very different about this location. The camp’s small, dilapidated wooden living quarters were called “barracks” and featured open, latrine-style bathrooms and showers. Somehow, my mother knew this place had a troubling past. “In those years, segregation was very prevalent,” she remembered. “We were not allowed to live within the white city limits of Caldwell. We had to drive 10 miles out of the city limit, then take this gravel road … And at the top of that gravel road was this encampment. It was surrounded by barbed wire. There’s no way around it: I knew that at one point that this place had been a prison camp for someone, but now it was the only place that Mexicans were allowed to live.” Other Mexican American farm workers who had been there longer soon told the family why the labor camp seemed like a prison. It had been a site of Japanese American incarceration during the second world war. It was part of a network of camps that warehoused more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent, rounded up and detained on racially motivated suspicions that they supported the enemy Axis powers of Japan , Germany and Italy. In Caldwell, they would have to prove their loyalty to the United States through work, producing sugar beets to fuel the American war machine. My family had unknowingly become part of a long line of laborers – white Depression-era migrants; Japanese Americans brutally uprooted from their homes and lives; and later Mexican, Mexican American and Indigenous workers – to call Caldwell home. But most of them weren’t free to come and go as they pleased, even with legal labor contracts. As the case of Caldwell demonstrates, the line between a farm worked by migrant labor and a prison can be a very blurry one indeed. My family’s experience is typical of 20th century Mexican American migrant farm laborers. Relegated to labor camps on the nation’s farms, they were forced to forfeit education and stability to follow seasonal crops and meager wages. Crossing borders – geographic, cultural and linguistic – was just a way of life. Though I’ve never worked the fields, I’ve frequently heard family stories about life on the road and the inherent violence of migrant farm work. The lesson I gleaned again and again was that to be a farm worker is essentially to be a prisoner and to live in constant fear of police and state violence. That lesson from my family’s long history in the fields set me on the path to become a scholar who studies how prisons and a deeply engrained culture of punishment shape migrant farm work. And for me, one key to understanding that culture lies in Caldwell and its sugar beet industry. The demand for migrant farm workers in Idaho steadily increased during the second world war, as the US military subsidized the production of several crops deemed essential to the war effort. Chief among them were sugar beets. Refined sugar was an important product for the development of military weapons. It could be refined and transformed into synthetic rubber, and sugar alcohols proved to be powerful explosives that drove the US war effort in the Pacific – used in everything from grenades and bombs to large artillery. According to a fact often cited by the US military, an acre of sugarcane produced a single artillery salvo for a Pacific warship. Hawaii – the center of American sugar production – was a battleground after the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. That status limited the availability of its sugarcane on the mainland, and companies like Idaho’s Amalgamated Sugar cashed in. Beet season normally lasts from early spring to fall and, during the mid-20th century, involved mowing down rows of planted beets with small hand hoes to remove excess plants. This type of work was, and still is, considered “stoop labor”, a term that describes the hunched-over position the work requires. Beet thinning was incredibly labor-intensive, and children in the fields weren’t spared. As my mother recalls: “I remember my hands getting so … sore. And I couldn’t close them anymore because of holding the hoe and just going and going because the fields are miles, miles long. And you work from sunup to sundown.” Beet work wasn’t only painful – it was also racialized. Fred Cummings, a Colorado sugar beet farmer and executive, pulled no punches about just who should do beet work when he addressed a congressional hearing on immigration in 1926: “There is not a white man of any intelligence in our country who will work an acre of beets … I do not want to see a condition arise again when white men who are reared and educated in our schools have got to bend their backs and skin their fingers to pull those little beets.” As he saw it, lawmakers really had only one choice in the face of potential white racial degradation: to “let us have the only class of laborers who will do the work”, a class that consisted of Asian, Mexican and Indigenous farmhands. It was no small wonder, then, that a grueling farm labor camp would be seen as a suitable place for incarcerated Japanese Americans. Originally built in 1939 by the now defunct federal Farm Security Administration, Caldwell was created as part of a nationwide system of camps to house displaced white workers after the Great Depression. While these workers were the first to live in the camp’s “barracks”, they were free to come and go and had greater labor protections in the fields around Caldwell. But with the outbreak of the second world war, things changed. The Caldwell labor camp was soon repurposed to house detained Japanese Americans and to satisfy the US military’s thirst for sugar. In March 1942, ​​President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9102, which ultimately removed Japanese Americans from their homes on the west coast to concentration camps. Just weeks before, the secretary of agriculture, Claude R Wickard, had demanded that the US produce an unprecedented number of sugar beets to provide fodder for explosives. This unprecedented demand for sugar caused panic among growers nationwide who anticipated historic labor shortages. To guarantee production and profits, the military, state governments and growers all envisioned newly incarcerated Japanese Americans as an “available” labor force. They created the Seasonal Leave Program (SLP), which took Japanese Americans away from larger camps like Minidoka in western Idaho, which housed an estimated 9,000 people, and shipped them to smaller labor camps like Caldwell to plant and harvest sugar beets. As the more than 30,000 Japanese Americans in the SLP between 1942 and 1945 would come to know, smaller labor camps were no less controlled than the sprawling complexes. In 1942, an agent of the United States Employment Services in Idaho reported: “The Japanese are not under armed guard but are under surveillance either in farm labor camps or on ranches. Deputy sheriffs are assigned to the camps and the movement of the inmates is restricted, particularly at night.” Even with thousands of captive laborers, the sugar machine kept churning, bringing even more non-white farm laborers to Caldwell. In 1943, the Caldwell labor camp also became a labor depot for the Bracero program , a US-Mexico pact that brought thousands of Mexican men to the US as migrant farm workers. In 1943, the first braceros came to Caldwell to work the beet fields alongside Japanese Americans in the same prison-like conditions. For all intents and purposes, they too were now “inmates”. For many in the SLP, the trauma of the farm labor camps is inseparable from that of the larger concentration camps. As Taka Mizote , who was first incarcerated at the larger Portland Assembly Center camp with her family and then at the SLP labor camp in Nyssa, Oregon – only 25 miles from Caldwell – reflects: “When I think about it, I think, ‘Oh that’s almost unbelievable how we survived under those conditions.’” When my family arrived in Caldwell, there were visibly reminded of farm labor’s carceral history. As my late uncle Marcus Zavala, who was born in Caldwell in 1968, recalled: “There was a prison light in the middle [of the labor camp], you know? They had that type of setup in a lot of places where we would go up to – not only Caldwell. We would go up to Washington and Oregon and work the apples. We would do the cantaloupe, oranges, grapefruits, lemons and limes in Texas. In Idaho, it was mostly either potatoes or beets. But it was the same [labor camp conditions] everywhere.” My family experienced the long afterlife of Japanese incarceration in Caldwell, as systems of surveillance and control didn’t disappear when Japanese Americans were permitted to leave after years lost to injustice. The historical and experiential overlap between Japanese Americans and Mexicans and Mexican Americans in Caldwell starkly illustrates how farmworkers in the US are treated as a particular class of prisoner outside prison walls. Today, all that remains of the Caldwell camp’s original architecture is a lone, abandoned barrack. I journeyed there in 2021. I found it with the help of past residents who still live in Caldwell, whose population is now more than a third Latino. I stood inside that barrack, running my hands along the walls. And I saw why my mother would recall her time there as a prison sentence. Though my family made a home there, it was an institutional home made of flimsy slab board, with only a single window looking out at farmland where generations toiled to make sugar for bombs.","Nora Zavala Gallion was 11 years old when she first set foot inside the farm labor camp in Caldwell, Idaho.

31,2024-09-27 16:00:36,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/sep/27/using-green-roofs-solar-chimneys-indoor-cooling,Green roofs and solar chimneys are here – experts say it’s time to use them,Energy,Sustainability,"T he US sweltered under record-breaking heat this year, with new research suggesting that air conditioning is no longer enough to keep homes cool. Spiraling energy demands and costs of indoor cooling now have planners looking to alternative ways to keep buildings cool – some fresh out of the lab, others centuries old. “The amount of buildings we expect to go up in the next couple decades is just staggering,” says Alexi Miller, director of building innovation at the non-profit New Buildings Institute (NBI). “If we build them the way we built them yesterday, we’re going to use a phenomenal amount of energy. There are lots of ways we could be doing this better. It’s not all fancy, emerging technology – there’s some basic stuff we don’t do nearly enough.” The Guardian spoke with architects, designers and developers about how they are building homes for a warmer planet. Homes built to passive housing standards – with airtight enclosures and thick insulation – are widely considered the gold standard for energy efficiency and indoor comfort, Miller said: “Basic efficiency stuff can get us nearly all the way there in terms of decarbonization.” Passive home design got its start in Germany in the 1980s and has caught on in the US in recent decades, with more than 16,000 units built or under construction as of last year, according to the Passive House Network. In April, developers in New York City completed what is now the country’s largest residential passive building: a 709-unit affordable housing complex. Passive homes typically use 80% to 90% less energy, Miller said. Though this type of building is growing in popularity, it is not yet mainstream. “One way that we have seen a lot of growth is through policy and financial levers, like energy codes” with stricter efficiency standards, and incentive programs that offer benefits like better zoning treatment or attractive finance rates, Miller said. He added that passive housing is especially promising as a way to lower energy costs for families struggling to pay their bills. Green exteriors have been used to insulate buildings going back to ancient Mesopotamia, and can lower indoor temperatures by as much as 7F (3.8C) . “The more green we can bring back, whether it’s on a roof or on a wall, it helps keep cities cool,” said Bruce Dvorak, a landscape architect at Texas A&M, who built his first green roof on Chicago’s city hall back in 2001. A typical green roof doesn’t absorb heat the way black, tarry shingles of conventional roofs do, and can help cool not just the buildings they cover but surrounding areas. They also absorb rainwater, preventing runoff that contributes to flooding. An ideal green roof is covered in lightweight soil and local vegetation, Dvorak said. In arid Texas, that might mean planting prickly pear and red yucca, whereas in woodsy Massachusetts you might use a native meadow. Similar planning goes for living walls: a frame is arranged against an exterior wall and covered with climbing plants, like yarrow and lavender, which can reduce energy costs by 23%. Green exteriors are growing in popularity as cities including New York and Chicago offer tax incentives for transforming asphalt and other non-porous surfaces into green spaces. Even the retail giant Walmart has built green roofs in Portland, Oregon, and Chicago. Dvorak sees enormous untapped potential: “You think of schools, shopping centers, buildings that have massive rooftops,” he said. “The federal government can really help support these initiatives … It’s the kind of thing that drives us crazy, because there is no reason not to do it.” Some builders are looking to built-in features to cool homes. Solar chimneys are dark-painted shafts attached to the sides of buildings. The chimney absorbs heat, and when that hot air rises, the suction forces cooler air to ventilate through the house. Combined with other passive cooling strategies, solar chimneys can reduce indoor temperatures up to 14F . Solar chimneys have been used for centuries in the Middle East, and started being used in the US around the 1960s, said Corey Saft, an architecture professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. In 2018, Harvard’s Center for Green Buildings and Cities installed a solar chimney on its headquarters as part of retrofit aimed at making the building require almost no energy for heating, cooling, ventilation or daytime electric lighting. Solar chimneys build on more widely used strategies of increasing airflow: “Before we had real careful building science,” says Saft, referring to hot places like Louisiana, “they would build leaky, because that would allow ventilation.” Another feature growing in popularity are chilled beams, which circulate cool water through ducts that are usually attached to the ceiling, which then radiate cool air. First developed in the 1970s, they are quiet, inexpensive to operate and easy to maintain, and can reduce energy use by about 30% . Miller, the NBI director, said that because the financial benefits of chilled beams only accrue over time, local and state governments need to create incentives to include these features to encourage widespread adoption. “We need to make the people planning the [building] project think about things in the longer term,” he said. This summer, researchers at the University of Chicago unveiled a new fabric that reflects sunlight as well as thermal radiation emanating from buildings, asphalt and other surfaces. Professor Po-Chun Hsu said that in tests, a wearable version of the fabric stayed 16F cooler than silk, and 3F cooler than cotton. He and his team are working on making the material more durable, so it can be used on building exteriors. “When you put [this] material under the sun, it won’t be heated by the sun, but it will also keep radiating, or losing heat, to the sky,” he said. “That’s how we can do the cooling.” He said his team was working on bringing the material to market and that it can be engineered to be eye-catching – which could be an added bonus as the material becomes a part of the cityscape. “By playing with the optical properties, at certain angles you’ll see different colors,” he said.","New research suggests that air conditioning is no longer enough to keep homes cool.

Latin America and the Caribbean recorded the steepest average declines in recorded wildlife populations, with a 95% fall, according to the WWF and the Zoological Society of London’s (ZSL) biennial Living Planet report . They were followed by Africa with 76%, and Asia and the Pacific at 60%. Europe and North America recorded comparatively lower falls of 35% and 39% respectively since 1970. Scientists said this was explained by much larger declines in wildlife populations in Europe and North America before 1970 that were now being replicated in other parts of the world. They warned that the loss could quicken in future years as global heating accelerates, triggered by tipping points in the Amazon rainforest, Arctic and marine ecosystems, which could have catastrophic consequences for nature and human society. Matthew Gould, ZSL’s chief executive, said the report’s message was clear: “We are dangerously close to tipping points for nature loss and climate change. But we know nature can recover, given the opportunity, and that we still have the chance to act.” The figures, known as the Living Planet Index, are made up of almost 35,000 population trends from 5,495 mammals, birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles species around the world, and have become one of the leading indicators of the global state of wildlife populations. In recent years, the metric has faced criticism for potentially overestimating wildlife declines. The index is weighted in favour of data from Africa and Latin America, which have suffered larger declines but have far less reliable information about populations. This has had the effect of driving a dramatic top line of global collapse despite information from Europe and North America showing less dramatic falls. Hannah Wauchope, an ecology lecturer at Edinburgh University, said: “The weighting of the Living Planet Index is imperfect, but until we have systematic sampling of biodiversity worldwide, some form of weighting will be necessary. What we do know is that as habitat destruction and other threats to biodiversity continue, there will continue to be declines.” Critics question the mathematical soundness of the index’s approach, but acknowledge that other indicators also show major declines in the state of many wildlife populations around the world. In a critique of the index published by Springer Nature in June, scientists said it “suffers from several mathematical and statistical issues, leading to a bias towards an apparent decrease even for balanced populations”. They continued: “This does not mean that in reality there is no overall decrease in vertebrate populations [but the] current phase of the Anthropocene [epoch] is characterised by more complex changes than … simple disappearance.” The IUCN’s Red List , which has assessed the health of more than 160,000 plant and animal species, has found that almost a third are at risk of extinction. Of those assessed, 41% of amphibians, 26% of mammals and 34% of conifer trees are at risk of disappearing. The index has been published days ahead of the Cop16 biodiversity summit in Cali, Colombia, where countries will meet for the first time since agreeing on a set of international targets to halt the freefall of life on Earth. Governments have never met a single biodiversity target in the history of UN agreements and scientists are urging world leaders to make sure this decade is different. Susana Muhamad, Cop16 president and Colombia’s environment minister, said: “We must listen to science and take action to avoid collapse. “Globally, we are reaching points of no return and irreversibly affecting the planet’s life-support systems. We are seeing the effects of deforestation and the transformation of natural ecosystems, intensive land use and climate change. “The world is witnessing the mass bleaching of coral reefs, the loss of tropical forests, the collapse of polar ice caps and serious changes to the water cycle, the foundation of life on our planet,” she said. Land-use change was the most important driver of the fall in wildlife populations as agricultural frontiers expanded, often at the expense of ecosystems such as tropical rainforests. Mike Barrett, director of science and conservation at WWF-UK, said countries such as the UK were driving the destruction by continuing to import food and livestock feed grown on previously wild ecosystems. “The data that we’ve got shows that the loss was driven by a fragmentation of natural habitats. What we are seeing through the figures is an indicator of a more profound change that is going on in our natural ecosystems … they are losing their resilience to external shocks and change. We are now superimposing climate change on these already degraded habitats,” said Barrett. “I have been involved in writing these reports for 10 years and, in writing this one, it was difficult. I was shocked,” he said.","Latin America and the Caribbean recorded the steepest average declines in recorded wildlife populations, with a 95% fall.

It began when she resigned as a sustainability consultant with Shell in 2009 and returned home to Colombia . She was 32 and disillusioned, a far cry from the heights she would later reach as the country’s environment minister, and one of the most high-profile progressive leaders in global environmental politics. Muhamad joined Shell an idealistic 26-year-old. “I really thought that you could make a huge impact within an energy company on the climate issue, especially because all their publicity was saying that they were going to become an energy company, meaning they will not be only a fossil fuel company,” she says, when we meet in the Colombian embassy in London. “I resigned the date that they decided to put their innovation money on fracking.” Now 47, Muhamad, whose surname comes from her Palestinian grandfather, is preparing to oversee biodiversity Cop16 , a summit on the future of life on Earth that will bring together leaders from nearly 200 countries in Cali, Colombia, next month. For many, she is a rising star of the environmental movement, joining voices such as the Barbadian prime minister, Mia Mottley, in putting forward an alternative vision of how the world could be, and demanding the developed world finance a just transition. “Susana is the Frida Kahlo of environmental geopolitics,” says activist Oscar Soria. “Like Kahlo, whose art challenged cultural norms and spoke of resilience, Muhamad paints a vision of ecological justice that goes beyond traditional environmentalism … an environmental agenda that is … reshaping the narrative around climate justice and biodiversity restitution.” Colombia’s embassy is sandwiched between Harrods and its Ecuadorian counterpart, and the room we meet in has a front row seat to the UK capital’s wealthiest extremes. Outside, a Rolls-Royce SUV and a blacked-out BMW wait with their drivers next to the high-end department store. Convertible supercars pass shoppers swinging luxury purchases from their hands. Muhamad, representing Colombia’s first ever leftist government, is entertaining NGOs, journalists and senior British politicians – and pushing a vision of “just transition” that would resolve economic imbalances alongside the environmental. The minister has had to be careful to avoid rhetoric on global inequality that might allow her political opponents to tie her administration to more radical leftwing politicians from her region, but she is not naive to the potential pitfalls on the path to net zero. “We have to be clear that this energy transition cannot be at the cost of Indigenous peoples, local communities and biodiversity,” she told the plenary hall at the conclusion of Cop28 in Dubai last December after a deal to transition away from fossil fuels was passed. “In this balance between opportunity and risk lies responsibility. I want to call on everyone to keep being mobilised because intergenerational justice with this text is still at stake,” she said. Colombia became the first significant fossil fuel producer to join an alliance of nations calling for a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty at the December meeting. President Gustavo Petro’s administration is pushing to ban fracking as it tries to phase out coal, oil and gas, pledging to make biodiversity the basis of its wealth in the post-fossil fuels era. Last month, she launched a $40bn investment plan aimed at making this vision a reality. Muhamad was one of the ministers leading efforts to include “phase out” in the final Cop28 text in Dubai – an attempt that was ultimately unsuccessful. Colombia and Brazil, under Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, have been leading efforts to end deforestation in the Amazon. The night before the embassy meeting, Muhamad addressed an event for the nature summit at the Natural History Museum. Standing under a blue whale skeleton and with a statue of Charles Darwin at her back, Muhamad underscored the urgency of the task, inviting the world to the “people’s Cop”. “As we decarbonise, we have to protect and recover nature because otherwise the climate will not stabilise,” she told the crowd. Muhamad has been quick to point out that decarbonisation efforts alone will be futile without the conservation of the natural world and the huge carbon sink it provides, which absorbs half of all human emissions each year. “There is a double movement humanity must make. The first one is to decarbonise and have a just energy transition,” she said in August while announcing her vision for the conference. “The other side of the coin is to restore nature and allow nature to take again its power over planet Earth so that we can really stabilise the climate.” The scientific backdrop to October’s conference is bleak. Figures from WWF show that wildlife populations have plunged due to a mixture of habitat loss, pollution, overconsumption, the spread of invasive species and global heating. Last year was the hottest ever recorded . The droughts and extreme heat have brought catastrophic consequences for Earth’s forests, grasslands and oceans: ecosystems that underpin human health, food security and civilisation. Despite the warnings, the UN’s biodiversity convention has long been overshadowed by its climate counterpart, and governments have never met a single target they have set for themselves on biodiversity. The summit also has important domestic significance. Since Petro, a former Marxist guerrilla, announced at the climate change Cop28 in Dubai last year that Colombia would host the biodiversity conference, he and Muhamad have put Cop16 at the heart of the domestic agenda, hoping to use it as a chance to bring lasting peace with hold-out rebel groups in forest areas. In July, Central General Staff (EMC), a guerrilla faction that rejected the country’s 2016 peace agreement, threatened the summit after a series of bombings and shootings that were blamed on the group, but it has since backed down on the threat. Even so, 12,000 soldiers and police offers will be in Cali to guard the conference. “It was a very strange situation, and we are also hoping to use Cop as a way to promote peace within the country,” Muhamad says. At home, her ministerial brief ranges from eliminating deforestation across the country, which has fallen to its lowest level in 23 years , to managing Pablo Escobar’s hippos , which have thrived east of Medellín since the drug lord’s death in 1993. Muhamad bursts into laughter when I ask about the hippos and what it is like managing them, before settling into a ministerial answer. She says the African mammals are being phased out with a mixture of euthanasia, sterilisation and hippo transportation: “For us, it’s very straightforward, they are an invasive species that have been declared [as such] officially, not even by this government, by the last government. I agree with that assessment. We have already adopted in April this year the plan to manage the hippo problem,” she says. Muhamad has lived in an eco-village in South Africa with miners, worked in human rights in Denmark and lived with campesinos in Colombia when she was a student before her first “formal” job with Shell. Now, she is preparing to be a Cop president for the first time, a role that requires her to focus on consensus and make good on her decision to leave Shell. When contact by the Guardian, the company said it is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 and they are investing $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions last year, which was 23% of our capital spending. Ultimately, she says of the vision she bought into at Shell: “I think it was greenwashing … There were people trying to push change but the regime of fossil fuels was too strong,” she says. “All of that influenced me to think that there was a more systematic change that needed to be made. And for me, the conclusion of that was politics.”","Susana Muhamad is one of the biggest opponents of fossil fuel on the world stage.

Now, its backsliding could threaten global progress",Wildlife & Conservation,Sustainability,"When diplomats struck a deal to save nature in 2022, pledging to halt biodiversity loss by the end of the decade, Europe was seen as a credible leader in fraught negotiations. The EU cajoled others into stepping up their game as it championed a target to protect 30% of the land and sea by 2030. But two years later, as delegates meet in wildlife-rich Colombia for Cop16 – the international summit to save nature – Europe’s own enthusiasm for saving species appears to be endangered. EU leaders scaled back plans to cut pollution and protect habitats after angry protests from farmers at the start of the year. A law to restore nature was turned into a political punching bag , barely securing majorities in key votes to rubber-stamp the deal, and a regulation to reduce deforestation will be delayed by a year, the commission announced last week. The backsliding has alarmed conservationists and scientists, who fear that biodiversity loss is being pushed to the sidelines on the eve of the world’s most significant nature negotiations. Guy Pe’er, an ecologist at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research, said the new line on nature was “exceptionally worrying” because the EU was perceived as a leader. “If other areas of the world take the same line, this can put us at a global risk of accelerating losses,” he said. The most vocal opponents of Europe’s nature protection plans are far-right parties, which completely oppose the EU’s “green deal”, and centre-right parties, which nominally back the project but have repeatedly tried to weaken it. Both groups gained seats at the expense of the Greens in European parliament elections in June, in a rightward shift that has been echoed in national and regional elections across the continent. EU member states agreed to downgrade protection of wolves in September, drawing criticism from conservationists who say it sends a “shameful signal” in the run-up to the summit. The move came shortly after Ursula von der Leyen, the returning commission president, announced her top team , with a shift in rhetoric that emphasised economic growth over the green agenda that characterised her previous term. Pe’er said: “Instead of resilience, sustainability and planetary boundaries – not to speak of nature or biodiversity – we now hear the words competitiveness, boosting our economy, and helping the industry. “This is not a small change to the tone of the green deal,” he said, “but rather a fundamental alteration of the underlying philosophy.” Europe’s recent efforts to protect nature have been mixed. The EU failed to meet its 2020 biodiversity targets and risks falling short of its 2030 protection targets, too. In 2021, most of its member countries failed to pay their fair share of a $20bn (£15.3bn) a year commitment to protect nature, according to an analysis from the ODI in June. Just eight of the 27 member states have revised their national biodiversity strategies and action plans, and only the same number have submitted pledges to protect nature . In June, however, the EU passed a landmark law to restore nature , rather than just protect it. It has also pushed through contested environmental rules on deforestation and sustainable supply chains – albeit in watered-down forms – to force action in countries from which it imports food and goods. Guido Broekhoven, a policy researcher at WWF, which recently released a tracker of national biodiversity strategies , said: “Other countries keep a close eye on its developments because ambitious action by the EU has a knock-on effect elsewhere. “Passing the nature restoration law was a step in the right direction, but it’s the implementation that really matters now,” he said. “The increasing pressure to delay implementation of the deforestation regulation, or worse, is also concerning.” Europe’s willingness to pay for nature protection abroad could also suffer from the rise of parties railing against migration and foreign aid. The Global Biodiversity Framework estimates an extra $700bn a year in biodiversity financing is needed between now and 2030 – 35 times more than what rich countries have promised poor ones. Špela Bandelj Ruiz, a Greenpeace biodiversity campaigner, said: “The last UN biodiversity summit got a good deal on paper, but this must be followed with action to protect Indigenous people’s rights, restore destroyed nature and finance all this fairly.” Nature is declining at unprecedented rates as the extinction of species accelerates, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services ( Ipbes ) found in a scientific assessment in 2019 . Although the biodiversity crisis does not receive the same attention and funding as climate breakdown, it has risen on the geopolitical agenda in recent years, allowing delegates to secure a significant global agreement in 2022 to stem biodiversity loss. David Obura, chair of Ipbes, said the forthcoming Cop16 summit would be the “first milestone” since then to agree on how to assess progress towards meeting the 2030 targets. It would also be an important space to share information on commitments, implementation and “gaps that urgently need to be filled” to halt and reverse the loss of biodiversity. Campaigners have warned of the growing threat to nature protection from far-right parties, which scored big wins in Austria’s recent election and performed well in three German states last month, but also warned politicians from elsewhere against aping their rhetoric. “We need healthy nature to have a hope for a safe future and resilient societies,” said Bandelj Ruiz. “Politicians from anywhere on the spectrum must recognise that they have a responsibility to protect their citizens and leave a livable planet for future generations.” Find more age of extinction coverage here , and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X for all the latest news and features","EU leaders scaled back plans to cut pollution and protect habitats.

175,2024-10-03 14:00:07,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/03/salmon-farming-canadian-waters-open-net-pen-salmon-farming-british-columbia-2029,‘I won’t believe it until I see it happen’: Could a ban on sea farms save Canada’s salmon?,Wildlife & Conservation,Sustainability,"On a clear August morning, Skookum John manoeuvres his fishing boat, Sweet Marie, out of the Tofino harbour and into the deep blue waters of Clayoquot Sound on Canada’s west coast. On shore, the late summer sun shines on visitors from all over the world who have flocked to the bustling fishing town on Vancouver Island, where they wander in and out of surf shops, art galleries and restaurants and pile into small boats in the hope of glimpsing orca, humpback and grey whales. “You’ll never find this anywhere in the world,” John says, gesturing through the Sweet Marie’s window at the mosaic of islands and mountains, cloaked in thick green rainforests, that form part of the Clayoquot Sound Unesco biosphere reserve . The Sweet Marie motors deeper into Clayoquot Sound, past a web of inviting channels and inlets, and cruises past a raft of sea otters resting in the gentle swells. Hunted nearly to extinction, sea otters are one of the celebrated species found in the reserve, along with sea lions, seals, wild salmon and bald eagles. John, a member of Ahousaht First Nation, makes his living on the water, where he helps train coast guard members in marine rescue, ferries passengers to islands and hot springs and takes visitors on whale watching tours. Today, he is taking members of Clayoquot Action , a conservation group focused on protecting wild salmon, to the site of one of the area’s more controversial industries: open-net pen salmon farms. Dan Lewis, the co-founder and executive director of Clayoquot Action, is incredulous that industrial salmon farming is allowed to take place in a globally recognised protected area. “Why are we doing this here?” he says, gesturing at the rich waters, home to a colourful array of sea life that includes giant rock scallops, tufted anemones in green, pink and white, dark green kelp forests, red sea urchins and purple-tinged Dungeness crabs. Clayoquot Sound is also home to some of the last 60 salmon farms left on North America’s west coast. For decades, as many as 100 farms in Canadian waters have raised mostly non-native Atlantic salmon in pens in the Pacific Ocean. But now the salmon farming industry, blamed for contributing to the collapse of wild salmon stocks, faces an uncertain future. In June, the Canadian government announced a ban on open-net pen salmon farming from coastal waters in July 2029, as part of a commitment “to protecting wild salmon and promoting more sustainable aquaculture practices”. Concerns about the industry’s impact on wild salmon played a leading role in the closure of about three dozen farms in British Columbia over the past seven years, after Clayoquot Action and other groups documented sea lice outbreaks and other diseases in farmed fish, including at farms along migration routes for wild salmon. T he decision to ban all remaining British Columbia farms, lauded by conservation groups and wild salmon advocates, has been soundly criticised by Canada’s salmon farming industry, which largely consists of multinational corporations that farm salmon around the world, including in the UK. The industry says moving salmon farming to closed containment systems on land or in the water, as the government suggests, is not logistically feasible and would be prohibitively expensive. For John, who has been campaigning against salmon farms since 2015, the Canadian government’s new 2029 deadline may just be an empty promise, after its earlier, unfulfilled commitment to remove open-net pen salmon farms by 2025 . “I won’t believe anything that the government says until I see it happen,” he says, as the Sweet Marie slowly circles a floating salmon farm in a small bay, barely a stone’s throw from the seaweed-strewn shore. John’s scepticism is shared by Hasheukumiss, hereditary chief of the Ahousaht Nation and president of the Maaqutusiis Hahoulthee Stewardship Society , which manages economic development for the nation. But the two men have very different perspectives on the salmon farming industry, mirroring broader divisions about whether open-net pen farms should be allowed to operate in Canadian waters. In 2010, the Ahousaht Nation signed an agreement allowing Cermaq Global, a Mitsubishi subsidiary that also farms salmon and trout in Norway and Chile, to operate in its territorial waters. The agreement was subsequently renewed with changes, according to Hasheukumiss, also known as Richard George. “One of the things that I wanted to address was the environmental concerns because we are the true stewards of our back yard,” he says. “It was the sea lice and the pathogens that were the biggest concerns we had.” According to Hasheukumiss, Cermaq was responsive and worked with the nation to address that concern. Hasheukumiss’ assessment of the Canadian government’s handling of fish farms is less rosy. Since he inherited his title in 2020, he says he has discussed the issue with three different cabinet ministers, yet has seen little in the way of consultation with his nation. A five-year transition away from open-net pen farms is not a realistic timeframe for the industry, he says. “In five years, there is no way this industry – or any industry – can go to fully contained systems.” A s the Sweet Marie noses slowly towards a rectangle of floating walkways bordered by black net fencing, John stands and slips the engine into neutral. He calls out to one of the salmon-farm workers, jokingly asking why he’s pretending to be busy. It’s his nephew, who recently started working at the Cermaq farm, one of 13 facilities in Clayoquot Sound that employ about 20 Ahousaht members. The two chat while Lewis stands at the Sweet Marie’s bow, peering through the nets to get a view into the pens, as part of the group’s regular monitoring of the industry’s operations. At an unstocked salmon farm nearby, the Cermaq’s delousing boat, Aqua Service, towers over the Sweet Marie from its berth. The vessel has a large rear deck fitted with a patented delousing system, which pulls fish from the pens and uses seawater to flush off the lice. The treatment process takes just two tenths of a second, aiming to reduce stress and fish deaths. In Ahousaht territory, Cermaq has been experimenting with technology to reduce the industry’s impact on wild salmon. A semi-closed containment system – consisting of a semi-permeable bag that stretches 25 metres below the water – is used to raise young salmon smolts while reducing their exposure to sea lice. The bag draws water from deep in the water column where sea lice can’t survive. Fewer sea lice on the farmed smolts make it less likely wild salmon swimming past the farms will pick up the parasites. After a year, the young salmon are moved to open-net pens to grow to marketable size. The semi-closed containment system Cermaq is trialling is expensive – costing C$20,000 (£11,000) a month in diesel alone. Brian Kingzett, executive director of the BC Salmon Farmers Association, representing Cermaq and other companies, says there is little appetite to make big investments and navigate the time-consuming licensing process for new technology, especially with the future of the industry in question. “There are lots of reasons why farmers want to go to closed containment for that first year; Cermaq has been trying to do it,” he says. “It took them six years to get a licence. We only have a five-year window.” Kingzett says the industry was “completely gobsmacked” by the Canadian government’s decision to remove open-net pen salmon farms by 2029, calling closed containment “an unfeasible option”. Setting up a medium-sized land-based salmon farm, capable of producing 5,000 tonnes of fish a year, could cost C$1.8bn (£1bn), according to a 2022 report commissioned by the British Columbia government. The report’s authors said it was difficult to estimate the costs of setting up large-scale farms because there are no land-based salmon farms in the world that are reliably producing large amounts of fish. BC’s first land-based salmon farm, Kuterra, is now raising steelhead trout, after achieving barely one-third of its production target, according to the BC government report. Another land-based venture, West Creek, has stopped farming salmon altogether. And on the other side of the country on the Atlantic coast, a land-based salmon farm, Sustainable Blue, suffered a mass die-off , reportedly because of an equipment malfunction , and is now in receivership. But Lewis says closed containment systems on land are the only option if the Canadian government is serious about protecting wild salmon stocks. “To our understanding, there is nothing that can actually have zero discharge that’s in the water,” Lewis says. “What we want to see in the next five years is all the farms come out of the water. We don’t believe there are any in-water solutions.” Kingzett says closing down open-net pen salmon farms will harm small coastal communities. Any land-based containment systems will need to be close to plentiful power and water supplies, not to mention customers, he says. If BC’s salmon farms disappear, Kingzett is confident farmed salmon will still be sold in the country’s supermarkets – but it will come from places such as Chile and Norway. Inside the Sweet Marie’s cabin, John has placed a sticker with the hashtag #FishFarmsOut near the helm. He is eager for the industry to leave Ahousaht territory, even if it means losing the money fish farming has brought to the community. “Wealth isn’t money,” he says. “What we have in our territory, what we have in the ocean, what we have in the air, that’s wealth.”","Clayoquot Sound is home to some of the last 60 salmon farms left on North America’s west coast.

47,2024-10-09 07:00:05,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/09/a-huge-loss-is-it-the-end-for-the-ship-that-helped-us-understand-life-on-earth,‘A huge loss’: is it the end for the ship that helped us understand life on Earth?,Climate Change,Public Health & Environment,"I n the early summer of this year, a ship set sail around the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. But this wasn’t any ordinary ship. For almost 40 years the Joides Resolution drilled into the ocean floor to collect samples and data that helped scientists to study Earth’s history and structure. Expeditions on the vessel have made a vital contribution to our understanding of the climate crisis, the tectonic plates theory, the origin of life on Earth and natural hazards such as earthquakes and eruptions. Yet the two-month voyage around Svalbard was to be its last. The National Science Foundation (NSF), the US agency that provided scientists at Texas A&M University with funds for the ship, announced last year it would not give money for the drilling vessel past September 2024. It was a declaration that shocked the global scientific community and meant that Svalbard would be the ship’s final outing. “Being deprived of this workhorse is devastating because we can’t get these data in any other way,” says Thomas Ronge, the project manager of the Svalbard expedition. “We are losing our potential to read the history book of climate change.” To understand the significance of the loss of the drilling vessel, it is useful to look at the evolution of this type of exploration and what it has attempted to achieve – in many cases successfully. It began in earnest in the early 1960s, when a group of scientists embarked on a mission to drill down from a floating barge, called Cuss I, to the border between the crust, the Earth’s outermost layer, and the mantle, the next and thickest layer. Project Mohole, as it was known, was recorded by the novelist and amateur oceanographer John Steinbeck in an article for Life magazine . “This is the opening move in a long-term plan of exploration of the unknown two-thirds of our planet that lies under the sea,” he wrote. “We know less about this area than we do about the moon.” That mission was ultimately unsuccessful but it laid the foundations for scientific ocean drilling, the concept of which is simple. Strata of sediments accumulate underwater, eventually becoming rock under pressure. Unlike on land, where disparate factors change the ground conformation in unpredictable ways, layers on the sea floor usually pile up at a regular pace and remain untouched. The deeper you drill, the further back in time you can go. After the failure of Mohole came the drill ship Glomar Challenger and, from 1985, the Joides Resolution. As recently as last year, 62 years after the Mohole project recounted by Steinbeck, scientists aboard the Joides managed to extract rock samples from the Earth’s mantle for the first time . “We did it,” said one of the expedition members to the New York Times . “We now have a treasure trove of rocks that will let us systematically study the processes that people believe are relevant to the emergence of life on the planet.” Yet such discoveries, at least using a US-funded vessel, appear unlikely in the near future. “[The end of the funding] is a huge loss to science and to everyone,” says Adriane Lam, a researcher at Binghamton University in New York, who was aboard the Joides this summer for the ship’s last expedition. “The stuff we’re finding has huge implications for things like where people live and may not be able to live in the future if the Earth keeps warming up.” On its last expedition, the Joides drilled into the sea floor to help scientists understand how an ice sheet in the Arctic Ocean collapsed thousands of years ago. Analysing how the Svalbard ice sheet melted, researchers hope to be able to model the possible collapse of a vulnerable equivalent in the west Antarctic. The NSF attributed its decision to end its funding to rising costs and a lack of financial support from the International Ocean Discovery Program’s partners. But many see the expenditure for the ship as paltry compared with its benefits. To put it in perspective, the total NSF budget for 2023 was close to $10bn (£7.5bn); the $71m spent on the Joides is 0.7% of that. The loss of the Joides also opens up opportunities for other countries to get ahead in the race for discovery. Some of the Joides’ crew have already been contacted by what may be the next protagonist of scientific ocean drilling: China. In December last year, Beijing launched its first drilling vessel, the Mengxiang, a super-advanced ship that will most probably take over the field. “People were shocked and caught out off guard when NSF made that announcement,” says Suzanne O’Connell, a professor of earth and environmental sciences at Wesleyan University in Connecticut. “In a way, the fact that the Chinese have built their vessel could help spur us to build a new one.” O’Connell did two expeditions with the Glomar Challenger and eight on the Joides. She is now appealing to US members of Congress and the media to try to salvage the ship. One slender hope remains for the Joides to avoid the scrapyard. A bill proposed to the House in July asked the NSF to use $60m to continue operating the vessel for at least three missions next year. According to a spokesperson for the congressman Michael McCaul – the Republican representative for Texas A&M University’s district who is pushing for the extra funding – the chances of the bill passing are “high”. However, it probably will not be voted on until mid-December at the earliest and its final text is anything but definitive. In the meantime, the equipment belonging to Texas A&M is being taken off the ship and the crew are likely to move to new jobs. It is not clear if there would be time to make the Joides operational again at that point, and James McManus, the NSF’s director of ocean sciences, says he “cannot speculate on this scenario”. With no guarantees for the future, several drilling projects have been postponed indefinitely, and an entire branch of science risks stalling, at least in the west. “We lose the ship, which is already a big blow,” says Ronge, now in Texas working on the cores from the last expedition. “But the worst part is losing the expertise, because if the people that can now run the ship blindfolded will find other jobs or retire, their knowledge will be gone. And without them it will take a decade before we return to full capacity.”","For almost 40 years the Joides Resolution drilled into the ocean floor to collect samples and data that helped scientists to study Earth’s history and structure. Expeditions on the vessel have made a vital contribution to our understanding of the climate crisis, the tectonic plates theory, the origin of life on Earth and natural hazards such as earthquakes and eruptions. The National Science Foundation (NSF), the US agency that provided scientists at Texas A&M University with funds for the ship, announced last year it would not give money for the drilling vessel past September 2024.",http://res.cloudinary.com/drwsupfyj/image/upload/v1728704396/state-of-the-earth/news_photographs/ahugelossisittheendfortheshipthathelpedusunderstandlifeonearth.jpg

However, their numbers have declined on the Catalan coast through a combination of pollution and unregulated recreational fishing. In 2017, a fortuitous meeting between a local fisherman, Isaac Moya, and a marine biologist, Boris Weitzmann, led to the creation of the Sepia Project, which has the twin objective of reviving stocks and keeping artisanal fishers in business. The project fixes tree branches to the shallow sea bed just beyond the Estartit harbour wall, as cuttlefish need somewhere solid to lay their eggs. “Fishers have been putting branches on the sea bed to attract cuttlefish for thousands of years,” says Weitzmann. “In Morocco they use palms; in Galicia, pines. Using this traditional method we attached different species of tree branches to ropes. It’s a case of looking to the past in order to move forward.” However, not content with waiting for the molluscs to lay their eggs, the project uses the underwater branches as incubators for eggs that attach to fishing nets. Moya set out to persuade others in his fishing comunity to save the eggs in buckets of water rather than throw them into the sea where they perish. The buckets are then left on the quayside and the eggs are distributed among the branches that serve as a nursery. Although he is well known locally, Moya does not come from a fishing family and at first had a hard time persuading others not to throw the eggs away. “Their attitude was a bit ‘what do you know?’,” he says, but fortunately several young locals were open to new ideas. In the first two years of the project they collected 1.5m eggs. “It’s important that Isaac doesn’t come from a family of fishers,” Weitzmann says. “In the history of humanity, innovation doesn’t come from within, it comes from outside. What we have done here is combine tradition and innovation to achieve a transformation.” The project is not just about conservation. It also aims to keep artisanal fishers in business by helping them to sell their catch at a fair price. “It’s a perfect example of the circular economy,” he says. They have chosen cuttlefish partly because they have a short life cycle. They lay their eggs in spring and after six to eight weeks the project takes the young to grow in the open sea. They reach maturity within a year, giving the fishers a good catch after the lean winter months. “Cuttlefish often die after they’ve laid their eggs,” Weitzmann says. “They have inbuilt planned obsolescence.” In effect, catching a mature cuttlefish once it has laid its eggs has little impact on the population. The project looked for support from bodies such as the nearby Montgrí national park but also from local businesses, ranging from car mechanics to a three-star Michelin restaurant, El Celler de Can Roca. “We wanted everyone to have a stake in it,” Weitzmann says. “We could have got more money from the European Union but what happens is you get the money to run a project for two years then they file it away in a drawer and that’s that. “We’re producing more cuttlefish but that’s not really the point,” he says. “We want to change the mentality of both fishers and consumers. “Consumers need to be educated about what they’re buying and where their money is going. Most people don’t ask or care. “As a fisherman, if I need €500 [£415]a month to cover my expenses and I’m paid €5 for a fish that’s worth €10, I have to catch twice as many fish,” says Moya. “The consumer is the primary cause of overfishing.” It is illegal in Spain for fishers to sell directly to the public. They have to go through the local association and then the wholesalers. “The system is based on a reverse auction, which pushes down prices and we artisanal fishers can’t compete with industrial boats,” says Moya. “They arrive with 500kg of cuttlefish and the price is set; we arrive with 10kg and no one is interested.” To combat this, a handful of fishers from l’Estartit and nearby l’Escala have set up Empesca’t, an organisation that aims to sell directly to local people and businesses, although Moya says neither the fisheries sector nor the regional government has encouraged them. Despite many setbacks, Covid among them, both Moya and Weitzmann remain optimistic. “It’s like fruit, you have to wait but eventually it ripens and falls,” Weitzmann says. “And besides, everyone knows that if we carry on the way we are, there’s no future.”","Cuttlefish ( Sepia officinalis) are a valuable catch for Spanish fishers.

431,2024-09-26 06:00:23,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/26/oil-pollution-in-uk-waters-far-worse-than-reported-says-conservation-group,"Oil pollution in UK waters far worse than reported, says conservation group",Pollution,Wildlife & Conservation,"The true extent of oil pollution released into UK waters by the fossil fuel industry has been “significantly underestimated” and it is putting marine wildlife at risk, according to a report released today. The conservation group Oceana said chronic oiling, defined as frequent, small scale releases, into the North Sea was much higher than estimated due to an “opaque” system of reporting oil discharges and spills. Oil companies must report both accidental oil spills and intentional discharges of so-called produced water – a byproduct that can contain oil and other toxic chemicals. The companies are allowed to release a certain volume of produced water but breaches of permitted levels are reported separately so escape full scrutiny, according to Oceana’s report. This caused underreporting of the total amount of oil released into the sea, it claimed. Using official data, Oceana estimated that when accidental spills and breaches of permitted discharges were added together, the recorded volume of everyday oil pollution should be increased by 43% over the past decade.“The system has been set up in such an opaque way it makes it difficult to understand the full volume of oil that is being discharged via accidental spills and permit breaches,” said Hugo Tagholm, executive director of Oceana. “No one except oil insiders can be sure of the true scale of it.” “Given so few sites are actually inspected, it is out of sight out of mind,” he said. “Even if people are caught, there is little enforcement.” Tagholm accused regulators of inadequate oversight of the industry, describing fines as “a drop in the ocean” compared with corporate profits. Oceana is calling for an increase in inspections and enforcement measures to prevent spills and breaches. A freedom of information request by Oceana revealed only 15% of oil and gas installations had been inspected by the Offshore Petroleum Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning (Opred) in 2023, down from 25% in 2022, according to the oceans group. Over the past five years, there have been two recorded convictions or fines for oil pollution, one for £7,000 against BP for a spill of 95 tonnes of oil. BP said at the time it had “regrettably” fallen short of its “high standards”, and that the incident “should not have happened”. Just five companies accounted for 80% of oil spills between 2011 and 2024, the Oceana report found, the worst offender being Total E&P. Five companies also accounted for 84% of all oil discharged via permit breaches, the worst being the Spanish oil giant Repsol, it said. Oceana’s report found that 248 “permit breach” releases were in UK marine sanctuaries. Dr Rosie Williams, a postdoctoral researcher at the Zoological Society of London, said: “ A growing body of research now recognises that the steady release of oil and other toxins into marine environments poses a huge threat to marine life .” A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: “Every oil spill, and discharge non-conformance is investigated by Opred proportionately, which can take enforcement action against operators if needed, including the use of fines or referral for criminal prosecution. We review and update guidance as required.” Mark Wilson, the health, safety, environment and operations director of Offshore Energies UK, which represents the industry, said that the latest Opred data, covering up until 2023, showed that oil mass in produced water had decreased since 2019. “Our industry is focused on driving continuous improvement in the production of oil and gas in the UK and communicating progress transparently and openly.” Repsol, approached for comment, referred the Guardian to Offshore Energies UK. A spokesperson for Total Energies said: “We’ve taken action to reduce discharges to sea, including investing in produced water re-injection wells across our North Sea assets, whilst also continuing to reduce the overall emissions associated with our operations”.","Chronic oiling is defined as frequent, small scale releases into the North Sea.

559,2024-10-11 07:00:44,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/11/labour-carbon-capture-climate-breakdown,Labour’s carbon-capture scheme will be Starmer’s white elephant: a terrible mistake costing billions | George Monbiot,Climate Change,Fossil Fuels,"T his will be Keir Starmer’s HS2: a hugely expensive scheme that will either be abandoned, scaled back or require massive extra funding to continue, after many billions have been spent. The government’s plan for carbon capture and storage (CCS) – catching carbon dioxide from major industry and pumping it into rocks under the North Sea – is a fossil fuel-driven boondoggle that will accelerate climate breakdown. Its ticket price of £21.7bn is just the beginning of a phenomenal fiscal nightmare. There might be a case for a CCS programme if the following conditions were met. First, that the money for cheaper and more effective projects had already been committed. The opposite has happened. Labour slashed its green prosperity plan from £28bn a year to £15bn, and with it a sensible and rational programme for insulating 19m homes. The government boasts that its CCS scheme will be “the equivalent of taking around 4m cars off the road”. But at far lower cost, through a rational transport policy , it could remove millions of real cars from the roads, while improving our mobility, cutting air pollution and releasing land for green spaces and housing. It could also launch a programme for the mass restoration of nature in the UK. The rewilding of land and sea would draw down vast amounts of carbon from the atmosphere while simultaneously reversing our ecological catastrophe. All these are cost-effective ways of eliminating greenhouse gas emissions. And all of them, unlike CCS, have “co-benefits”: they achieve more than one good thing. That £21.7bn is the budget for construction only. To judge by decades of expensive CCS failures , it’s likely to be highly optimistic. The UK’s three previous attempts at CCS (the 2005 Peterhead plan , the 2011 demonstration project and the 2012 funding competition ) were all cancelled as a result of cost escalation. An analysis by Oxford University’s Smith School shows that a heavy reliance on CCS massively increases the costs of cutting emissions. By contrast to other technologies such as solar, wind and batteries, its costs have not fallen at all in 40 years. When I asked the government what guarantee it could provide that construction costs would be capped at £21.7bn, it gave me a woolly answer about “value for money”, but no such reassurance. And this is just the start of it. Buried in an obscure ancillary document is a government commitment to pay a “premium” for the hydrogen component of the CCS programme for 15 years. How much will the total cost of this be? Again, no clear answer. Cutting cost-effective measures in favour of an open-ended, staggeringly expensive programme is the very definition of fiscal irresponsibility. The second condition is that CCS will accelerate or complete the UK’s decarbonisation. But there’s a reason why oil and gas companies have lobbied so forcefully for this policy: it licenses continued fossil fuel production. The government’s CCS decision has been sold to us as a way to deliver blue hydrogen. This means hydrogen made from fossil gas , as opposed to green hydrogen, which is made by electrolysis with renewable electricity. An analysis by the climate experts Carbon Tracker shows that the additional gas demand caused by the UK’s CCS blue hydrogen programme will greatly increase overall emissions. It would exhaust the UK’s domestic gas supply, which would then necessitate importing liquefied gas (LNG) from the US and other sources. The government knows this, which is why it intends to approve the construction of an LNG terminal at Teesside . LNG from the US, thanks to the impacts of fracking, liquefaction and leakage, releases higher greenhouse gas emissions than coal. Blue hydrogen produced from LNG massively exceeds the low carbon hydrogen standard with which the entire programme is justified. Far from accelerating decarbonisation, Labour’s CCS scheme locks in high emissions and fossil fuel dependency for decades to come. Don’t take it from me. Take it from the government. There’s a rule applied to all such spending, called “ principle H ”. It says: “subsidies for the decarbonisation of emissions linked to industrial activities in the UK shall achieve an overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.” Uniquely, the government has decided that principle H is “ not applicable ” to its CCS programme. Otherwise, it notes, the scheme could not proceed, because “liquified natural gas is associated with increased upstream emissions of greenhouse gases”. The breathtaking excuse it gives for rescinding this principle is that the state will “subsidise the construction” of CCS plants but “not their operation”. This is untrue and nonsensical. Labour ministers are spending £21.7bn on an alleged climate project that will increase emissions, and they know it. The third condition is an audit of the carbon emissions that cannot be eliminated by other means. The government tells me there are “no viable alternatives” to CCS for “decarbonising key industrial sectors (eg cement)”. But what if there are? What if conventional cement production were replaced with geopolymeric cement ? What if green hydrogen were used to make steel ? What if thermal power plants were no longer required for electricity production? No such audit has been conducted. Already, as Carbon Tracker has shown , the assumptions behind the CCS programme are outdated. The decision to deploy CCS comes before an attempt to determine whether it is necessary. That’s what happens when fossil fuel lobbyists drive government policy. When I asked the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero for background documents, all those it sent me were published by the previous government . None had been updated since Labour took office. This, in other words, is Tory policy. My guess is that Labour feared that dropping the Tory programme, with its massive handouts to corporations, would trigger a concerted attack by lobby groups and the billionaire press, alleging it was “anti-business”. Our money is being used for political purposes. Starmer campaigned on a platform of “ change ”. But there has been no change from this demented Tory policy, no change in the influence of the fossil fuel industry, no change in the perverse justifications. And, I suspect, there will be no change from £50bn for this profligate CCS scheme. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, talks of a fiscal “ black hole ” of £21.9bn. But this is a real black hole: a long tunnel into the rocks, down which £21.7bn and more will be poured. A more reliable and cost-effective means of sequestering carbon would be to bundle up the money (roughly 1,100 tonnes in £20 notes) and shove it down the pipe.","The government’s plan for carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a fossil fuel-driven boondoggle that will accelerate climate breakdown.

The storm thankfully lost some of its force before it slammed into Florida , making landfall on Wednesday night as a category 3 hurricane. But many more lives would surely have been lost without the massive evacuation and the deployment of thousands of national guard troops and personnel from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. This was the second direct hit on the state in less than a fortnight, after Hurricane Helene, which killed at least 225 people in the US. The hotter ocean temperatures which worsened these storms are hundreds of times likelier because of human-made global heating, a new analysis has shown . Climate change may have increased the rain dumped on parts of the south by Helene by 50%, scientists believe . Another study has suggested such double punches could arrive every three years thanks to the continuing burning of fossil fuels. Extreme weather is becoming the new normal. This autumn there has been heavy rain in the Sahara and flash floods in Myanmar, Vietnam and Thailand. They follow spring’s torrential rain in Brazil, the United Arab Emirates and Kenya, and heavy flooding in Germany. Lethal heatwaves hit south and south-east Asia and then the Mediterranean. What marks Florida out is the disparity between the concern rightly given to the consequences of the storms and the widespread unwillingness of many there to acknowledge the causes of extreme weather – still less the role in it that the US plays. It has the greatest planet-heating emissions per capita of the top 10 emitters. Global heating makes preparing for such events, and recovering from their consequences, more essential than ever. But it is ludicrous to take such steps without also addressing what is making them more extreme and more frequent. Ron DeSantis, Florida’s Republican governor, warned that Milton would do “an awful lot of damage”. Yet not only is he aggressively pro-fossil-fuel, and the signatory of a ban on wind energy infrastructure. He is a climate change denier who has signed a bill erasing the words from Florida statutes. Donald Trump, expected to win the state in November, has lied about the federal government failing those affected by Helene. But a second Trump administration would lead to many more victims of global heating. He has called the climate crisis a “hoax” and a “scam”. His campaign has pledged to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord again if he is re-elected and to roll back the Biden administration’s clean energy drive. While they refuse to accept the scientifically established truth that human activity is heating the planet, parts of the Republican right indulge in absurd conspiracy theories, with Marjorie Taylor Greene suggesting on X that “they can control the weather”. Kamala Harris’s backing for new fracking projects and expanded US gas production is patently aimed at voters in key swing states, but is nonetheless disappointing for that. The Democrats, however, have at least diagnosed the problem and begun to address it, albeit inadequately. The other party doesn’t even want to hear its name. Global heating is not only a fact but an accelerating phenomenon . Voters going to the polls next month should remember that Mr Trump’s return to the White House would increase the danger that the climate crisis poses to people in the US and elsewhere.","Hurricane Milton made landfall on Wednesday night as a category 3 hurricane.

For politicians, the problem with clarity is that it demands action. Complexity provides safety because action can more easily be avoided. And so the obvious and clear are painted as “ extreme ”, while the complex is regarded as “mature”. For example, rather than reduce emissions or prevent commercial activity and expansion in areas where native species are under threat, the government has hosted a “ Global Nature Positive Summit ”. Apparently helping to “build consensus on the economic settings needed to increase investment in nature” is better than doing what scientists say is needed. It might seem obvious that companies will not solve the climate crisis nor save threatened species, but instead we get wrapped in the mature and complex world where “corporate leaders will explore the pivotal role businesses play in achieving our national and global biodiversity goals and highlight ways to embed nature into corporate strategy”. Let’s hope they embed that strategy before the Maugean skate is extinct . Complexity hides things. But Australia’s emissions reductions are actually not complex. Almost all the reduction in emissions since 2005 has come from not clearing as much land as we did in 2005 (the “land use” category of emissions). Conversely, all the reductions to be madefrom now into the future (or at least until 2030) will need to come from reducing actual emissions. If the graph does not display, click here When the Albanese government was elected, there were 92 months to go till 2030; now there are 63. To state the obvious, a third of those 92 months are used up, and Australia’s emissions have not fallen at all. It seems pretty clear that offsetting increased emissions will not actually reduce emissions. And yet that is the policy the government is committed to. Similarly, we are told the housing affordability crisis is complex. The solution is multifaceted and might even require introducing tax incentives to get older couples to rent out their spare rooms . Or perhaps, as the Queensland government has shown, the solution is rather more obvious and involves buying up vacant properties and using them for low-cost housing. Governments obviously also need to build new homes: If the graph does not display, click here I am often told that it is too simplistic to point to the fact the 25-year decline in housing affordability occurred after fewer public-sector homes were built and the tax system was changed to incentivise speculation and tax avoidance. Saying it’s more complex avoids stopping what hasn’t worked (and which has made things worse). The cost-of-living crisis is also, we are told, a very complex thing. As an economist I could write about the interaction of demand and supply pressures to ensure you stopped reading because it is all too much to understand. But we saw last month that companies such as Woolworths and Coles have massive pricing power – the prices they set have little to do with costs and more to do with profit. They set the prices – you don’t go in and haggle over the price of a packet of chips. Regardless of potential breaches of law, those companies have obviously abrogated their social licence and need greater oversight by a body that can actually demand explanations for why they have coincidentally decided to take it in turns having Coke on special every other week. Also, rather obviously, the main reason for the cost-of-living crisis is that wages have grown much slower than prices. Back in March 2020, the average annual full-time wage was about $90,000. Had a person earning that received pay rises in line with the wage price index, their wage would now be worth $4,300 less in real terms. If the graph does not display, click here In effect, they can now buy as much with their wage as they did back in 2009. An obvious solution is that wages need to grow faster than prices. We will be told this is too simple – we need to care about productivity (and we’ll ignore that measuring productivity is actually complex, and instead pretend it is simple and accurate) and that prices might rise if wages start to grow too fast. After the past three years, we know that is just an argument by business groups to not have to pay workers more. It’s the same thing we see with calls to abolish the junior award rates . Everywhere in society someone aged 18 is treated as an adult, except when they get paid. That seems obviously wrong, especially when you consider that even with award rates set by the Fair Work Commission, in real terms someone on the award has a wage worth less than was the case 5 years ago: If the graph does not display, click here The ACTU is arguing that those who earn up to 30% less than the award because they are under 21 should be paid as the adult they are. Business groups and major supermarkets will argue, however, the issue is more complex and that it will cause prices to rise and reduce employment. These, of course, are the same companies that now get their customers to effectively work for free by checking out items, and which have profited nicely during the cost-of-living crisis. But we know that raising incomes reduces poverty (I know … obvious). It happened during the pandemic when the Morrison government doubled jobseeker briefly: If the graph does not display, click here Prevent the destruction of native habitats, reduce actual emissions instead of offsetting them, build more homes, pay adults as adults, increase welfare payments so that people don’t live in poverty. Are these ideas too obvious? Not mature enough? Maybe someone might think them “extreme”? But they don’t hide behind a facade of complexity to avoid fixing a problem.

So what is “real zero” and could Fortescue really decarbonise a business that’s part of a global steelmaking industry responsible for about 9% of global CO2 emissions? Forrest’s attack on “net zero” is not likely to win him many friends. A stocktake of net zero pledges around the globe by Net Zero Tracker found 60% of the 2,000 largest companies have net zero targets covering about $45tn in revenue. But the analysis also said only 61 of the net zero plans of those 1,145 companies met all integrity criteria, such as the appropriate use of offsets or whether the target covers the entire climate impact of a company. The original concept of “net zero” was for global economies to end almost all fossil fuel use and then use technologies, many not proven at scale, to directly cut atmospheric CO2. But examples are legion of major corporates buying carbon offsets, some of dubious quality, to make their emission reduction targets instead of actually cutting fossil fuel use. Claire Snyder, the founder and director of Climate Integrity, said: “Andrew Forrest is right on this: the ‘net’ in net zero is a loophole that is frequently exploited. “Fossil fuels are the primary cause of climate change, yet hardly any companies have explicit plans to phase out coal, oil and gas from their own operations.” Fortescue’s latest climate transition plan , published last month, reflects Forrest’s disdain for carbon offsets. Offsets and carbon capture are not part of Fortescue’s plans. Fortescue says its annual emissions that it has direct control over were at 2.72m tonnes of CO2-equivalent last year. Most of that comes from the diesel burned by haulage trucks, trains and ships, and the gas burned for power generation at its mining sites. By 2030 Fortescue aims to have eliminated all those fossil fuels with a combination of green fuels (such as ammonia for shipping and clean hydrogen for power generation) and battery electric vehicles charged with renewables. Simon Nicholas, a global steel sector analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said Fortescue’s operations are concentrated in the remote Western Australia Pilbara region, giving the company ample access to solar and wind and the space needed to build them. “It seems like the technology to enable Fortescue to reach real zero is either already available or will be soon,” he said. “Real zero by 2030 is very ambitious, but even if they hit the target a bit late, they will have transformed operational mining emissions and laid the path for others to follow.” Fortescue’s (and the climate’s) much bigger problem comes when its iron ore goes to overseas steelmakers that use combinations of coal, gas and fossil-fuel powered electricity to turn the ore into iron, and the iron into steel. The indirect emissions (called scope 3) from the shipment and use of Fortescue’s iron ore last year were 100 times the company’s direct emissions: about 262 Mt CO2-e (for comparison, Australia’s entire annual emissions are now at 440 Mt). About 97% of that is emitted in the steelmaking process. But Fortescue has a target for “net zero scope 3 emissions by 2040” – an odd choice of the “net zero” phrase given Forrest’s dislike of it. But could it be done? Most of Fortescue’s iron ore is low-grade and not suitable for a process known as Direct Reduced Iron, where the ore is turned into iron metal using gas. But this DRI process could be emissions free, Nicholas said, if the gas were replaced by clean hydrogen. Fortescue says it is working on ways to tweak the DRI process that would allow use of its lower grade ore to produce “green metal”, while also developing higher grade ore deposits (such as its massive Iron Bridge mine ). The company is also building a pilot green metal production plant . The company told analysts a few months ago that “pivoting to producing green metal” was its planned next step. Once you have iron, about a third of steelmakers use electric arc furnaces to produce the steel and these too can be powered by renewables. “The technology to decarbonise iron and steelmaking is already available,” Nicholas said. “Electric arc furnaces and renewable energy are perfectly mature technologies. DRI is also mature and in use today at commercial scale … “The technology to do this at commercial scale is available now,” he said, pointing to a green steel manufacturing plant in Sweden . But questions linger over how much control Fortescue can have over the source of power generation for electric arc furnaces. Furnaces not powered by renewable electricity but using Fortescue’s ore or green iron would still leave the company with scope 3 emissions. “The key challenge is what happens to Fortescue’s future green iron production when it reaches steelmakers in places like China,” Nicholas said. On this, Fortescue’s plan just says it will “partner” with customers and establish a “green metal value chain”. Temperature Check asked Fortescue why it had used the term “net zero” for its scope 3 target and how it would convince its customers to go “real zero”. A Fortescue spokesperson said ending reliance on fossil fuels “is the only way to secure the global temperature goals of the Paris agreement” and the company backed “all companies and governments” in phasing out fossil fuels “no later than 2040”. Fortescue was working with “global science-based standard setting entities” to understand trends that could “impact best-practice Scope 3 target”, the spokesperson said, adding the company may change its position. “Fortescue has a policy to not use voluntary [carbon] offsets towards its real zero 2030 target and only supports genuine decarbonisation solutions such as investment in green iron and other innovations necessary to eliminate scope 3 emissions in the iron ore industry. “If every company takes the necessary action to reduce their scope 1 and 2 emissions, for which they are directly responsible, then globally scope 3 emissions will decline quickly.” Sign up to Breaking News Australia","Fortescue says its annual emissions that it has direct control over were at 2.72m tonnes of CO2-equivalent last year.

1346,2024-10-10 11:03:00,Yale Environment 360,https://e360.yale.edu/features/gavin-schmidt-interview,What’s Causing the Recent Spike in Global Temperatures?,Climate Change,Public Health & Environment,"About 18 months ago, climate scientists began to notice something strange. In March of 2023, global sea surface temperatures started to rise. In a warming world, the seas would be expected to grow hotter, but the rise, which came at a time when the Pacific Ocean was in the neutral phase of the weather pattern known as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, was unusually steep. In April, 2023, sea surface temperatures set a new record. They did so again in May. As the months went on, the weirdness continued. In the summer of 2023, the world entered an El Niño, the warm phase of ENSO. El Niños typically bring higher temperatures, but in the second half of 2023, both sea surface and air temperatures increased so much that scientists were stunned. One called the figures “absolutely gobsmackingly bananas.” In an essay that appeared in Nature this past March, NASA’s chief climate scientist, Gavin Schmidt said: “It’s humbling, and a bit worrying, to admit that no year has confounded climate scientists’ predictive capabilities more than 2023 has.” Officially, the El Niño ended in May 2024. But global temperatures have remained stubbornly high. This year they are expected to set yet another record. Schmidt says that scientists still can’t explain the unexpected spike in temperatures. When I talked with him recently, he called the continuing confusion “a little embarrassing” for researchers.  Scientists have identified several recent developments that could have contributed to the last year and a half of anomalous warmth. The first is a set of rules that reduced the sulfur content of the fuel used in super tankers. Since sulfur dioxide pollution reflects sunlight, this change, while good for public health, could have led to increased ocean heating. A second potential contributor is an unusual eruption that occurred in January 2022. Normally, volcanoes emit sulfur dioxide and so produce temporary cooling. But the eruption of Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha‘apai, an underwater volcano in the South Pacific, sent water vapor shooting into the stratosphere, which could have had a warming effect. Yet another possible contributor is the solar cycle. The sun is currently at, or near, a peak of activity, and this, too, could be boosting temperatures. At this point, though, Schmidt says, none of these developments — or even a combination of all of them — seems sufficient to explain the heat. This, in turn, raises several other possibilities. The recent temperature run-up could be the result of some development that’s yet to be identified. Or it could mean the climate system is more unpredictable than was thought. Alternatively, it could indicate that something is missing from climate models, or that amplifying feedbacks are kicking in sooner than the models had predicted. I spoke with Schmidt, who is the director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, over Zoom. Gavin Schmidt. NASA Elizabeth Kolbert: When did people like you start to say, “Okay, there’s something going on here that is not what I expected?” Gavin Schmidt: We started to see something eyebrow-raising in the spring in 2023. We expected that 2023 would be another warm year because all of the years are warm now, but it probably wasn’t going to be a record-warm year. So when the records started to be broken, first in the North Atlantic in March and April, June, and then the global mean in June, and then throughout the rest of the year, and then absolutely ridiculously large record-breaking events in the fall — August, September, October, November — people started using adjectives that scientists don’t generally tend to use. At the end of 2023, we summed it up: It was a record warm year and it was a record-breaking size of the record. Our eyebrows at this point were rolling over the top of our heads. It was clear that the predictions that people had made at the beginning of year were all wrong. It doesn’t matter what the method was, they were all wrong, and they were all wrong by about 0.2 degrees Celsius. Now that doesn’t sound like a lot, but it’s a big deal. You can accommodate a missed prediction in two ways. You can either say, your actual prediction was wrong. Or you can say, no, we underestimated the uncertainty. So at the beginning of 2024, we thought: Hopefully we’ll get some more information from people doing science for all the different things that were happening. And maybe we’ll get some more analyses of the internal variability. Some of that has happened, but not in a coordinated way. And it’s still pretty much, I would say, amateur hour in terms of assessing what actually happened in 2023. Kolbert: There was a whole list of things people thought might have contributed. Schmidt: Right. One was a change in regulations by the International Maritime Organization, which took effect in January 2020 to clean up the fuel that was being used for shipping . “Things are behaving in a more erratic way than we expected, and that means the future predictions may also be more off.” One other event was the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haʻapai volcano in the South Pacific, which was a very unusual eruption. It put a lot of water vapor into the stratosphere, which is normally super dry. That was a very new thing, and people were saying, well, maybe that’s contributing. People were also talking about unusual behavior of the Saharan dust or the wind pattern in the North Atlantic. People were talking about long-term, ongoing changes in how much pollution is coming from China and India. Maybe those things are changing faster than we anticipated. The pollution in the air is a cooling factor, and so if you take it away, then that’s a warming factor. The science that’s been done has not been equally spread amongst all of those things. A lot of people have looked at the impact of the marine shipping regulation change. If you take that and you put it into some climate model and you estimate the temperature change, right now you’d expect about 0.05 of a degree, 0.08 of a degree [of warming per year ], and then building over a decade to about 0.1 degree. So that seems like it helps, but it doesn’t seem like it’s sufficient. And the first paper that came out about the volcano, they said, no, no, the normal cooling volcanic pollution is still bigger than the warming water vapor component. So now I have more warming to explain and less things to explain it. We are still waiting on the assessments of emissions from China. We don’t have what’s happening to pollution. The January 2022 eruption of the underwater Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano produced water vapor that could have had a warming effect. NOAA Kolbert: We don’t have it because we don’t have a data collection method? Schmidt: All of the forecast systems are now using input files that are out of date. And for some of them a lot. Kolbert: [In March you wrote in Nature ] that “a warming planet is already fundamentally altering how the climate system operates, much sooner than scientists had anticipated.” What did you mean by that? And what are your thoughts on that now, six months later? Schmidt: Like I said, there’s two reasons why you could have messed up the prediction. One is you are missing some driving element. Another is you are underestimating the spread. Things are behaving in a more erratic way than we expected, and that means the future predictions may also be more off. And you could think of things being more off in multiple ways because the system is changing in a way where what happened in the past is no longer a good guide to what’s going to happen in the future. And that’s concerning. For example, we have huge industries and huge expectations based on temperature anomalies that are associated with [El Niño]. So if we predict an [El Niño] coming, then people in Africa start planting different crops. People in Indonesia start preparing for a dry season. If the connections between the rest of the world and what’s happening in the tropical Pacific are changing, then all of those previous practices or recommendations based on the past relationships, maybe they’re no longer any good. And if that is now the new normal, there’s no new normal. “The big uncertainty that determines whether 2100 is a happy place or a less happy place is our decisions on emissions.” But if it’s the forcing from the volcano was a little bit larger than we thought, then all previous stuff is still fine, and the history is fine, and we can just make a correction for that one volcano, right? But we haven’t been able to pin that down yet, and that’s a little embarrassing for the community. Kolbert: How do we resolve this? Schmidt: We need to get updates to these input data sets. We have got 15 or 20 modeling groups ready to look at exactly at the questions that everybody seems to be interested in. And we’re just twiddling our thumbs going, where’s the data? Kolbert: If things are happening faster than anticipated, that would seem to be extremely concerning. Schmidt: It is. There are real decisions that need to be made, and we are giving people information that effectively dates from the last IPCC report in 2020. And for most things it’s probably fine, but I’d feel a lot more confident if we had a process in place that updated these things, not every day, but maybe once a year. Kolbert: What should lay people know? Schmidt: We are going to get to 1.5 degrees a little faster than we anticipated even four years ago. I think this year it’s about 50-50 whether we will reach 1.5 degrees in the [NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies] temperature record. A satellite view of ship trails in the North Pacific. New limits on pollution have resulted in fewer trails, which have a cooling effect. NASA Kolbert: I know that people like you don’t like to answer questions like this, but I’m going to ask you anyway, since I believe you’re sitting at home, and maybe that’s even a picture by your daughter behind you. What concerns you most as a dad about the data that you’ve seen over the last year and a half? Schmidt: My daughter was born in 2015, which means that she may well live to 2100. So the projections that we make, she’ll see how that all works out. We are looking at very, very small amounts of tea leaves to try and predict the future. What happened this month? What happened last month? What was going on in Sahara? What was going on in the Antarctica? But the big uncertainty that determines whether 2100 is a happy place or a less happy place is our decisions on what we do with emissions. And they dwarf the uncertainties that we’re talking about here. We’re talking 0.1, 0.2 degrees. Well, the difference emissions make is 1 degree, 2 degrees, 3 degrees. So it’s an order of magnitude larger. And given the non-linearity of impacts, that’s a much, much larger amount of impact that we would see. Having things happen faster [than anticipated] might encourage people to act more aggressively, or reaching 1.5 degrees might cause people to stop bothering. That’s very difficult to predict. I have this feeling that what we’re doing will influence these decisions, but I don’t know how it will influence these decisions. And so my best plan is just to do the best that we can in terms of the science and hope that by knowing more about the system, people will make better choices. But obviously that’s hopelessly naive. Kolbert: One has to cling to what one’s got. Schmidt : I mean, if we really felt that people would make better decisions without information, you would not be a journalist. I would not be a scientist. We would not believe in democracy. This interview was edited for length and clarity.","In 2023, global sea surface temperatures started to rise.

1602,2024-10-08 11:53:00,Yale Environment 360,https://e360.yale.edu/features/madagascar-rosewood-singapore-trafficking,How Traffickers Got Away with the Biggest Rosewood Heist in History,Wildlife & Conservation,Public Health & Environment,"On March 11, 2014, the MV Oriental Pride , a 325-foot-long, roughly 5,000-ton, Kelly green cargo ship, arrived in the port of Jurong, Singapore, where it was met by agents with Singapore’s Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority. Aboard, the agents discovered an amazing haul: some 30,000 Madagascar rosewood logs, enough to cover two football fields 10 feet deep. Observers later estimated that the logs seized in Singapore were worth at least $50 million. It was the single biggest seizure of an illegally trafficked species in history. Harotsilavo Rakotoson, a lawyer, ordinarily works on corporate civil cases. But rosewood had recently been a topic of much discussion in Madagascar, and the seizure interested him. He offered his help to the Malagasy government, in what he assumed would be an open-and-shut case: According to international treaty and both Malagasy and Singaporean law, the logs were protected, belonging to endangered or threatened species. Felling the trees in the first place was illegal, let alone trafficking them across international borders. Rakotoson expected the logs would be quickly returned to Madagascar. Instead, the litigation would stretch on for years, ending with a legal victory for the traffickers, and the logs themselves stuck in a kind of limbo, where they remain today. Madagascar’s government, meanwhile, is contemplating creating a legalized domestic trade in rosewood, a move that critics say would undermine international conservation efforts. “Ten years later,” Rakotoson says, “I think I can be a little naive.” Rare and beautiful species like rosewood are a concrete source of money in an impoverished country like Madagascar. Rosewood can be worth as much as $1.5 million per cubic meter, according to a recent United Nations report . It is one of the precious woods of antiquity, in the same rarified class as ebony, sandalwood, and lignum vitae. Prized for its density, stability, and beauty, it has long been used to make musical instruments, tool handles, and most of all, traditional Chinese furniture; the name for an entire category of design, hongmu , means, simply, “red wood.” During the Cultural Revolution, most existing hongmu furniture was destroyed, but by the mid-2000s, the swelling Chinese middle class had reacquired the taste. With Southeast Asia’s native stocks of slow-growing rosewood depleted, lumber suppliers turned their sights elsewhere — especially to Madagascar, which has more species of rosewood than anywhere else in the world. The island is home to staggering biodiversity, containing more species of plants than the entire Congo Basin, although it is just one-fifth the size. The vast majority of its plant and animal life are endemic, occurring only there. This biodiversity is an enormous trove of unique genetic material, of evolutionary history and potential. But rare and beautiful species like rosewood are also a concrete source of money in an impoverished country. Since Madagascar’s independence in 1960, its population has ballooned from 5 million to more than 30 million people, roughly four-fifths of whom live in poverty. A Malagasy man chops down a rosewood tree in Madagascar's Masoala National Park in 2009. Toby Smith In 2009, protesters supported by the Malagasy army overthrew the government. In the chaos that followed, organized crime — what its opponents describe as “the Rosewood Mafia” — finally had the opportunity to take full advantage of the surging demand. Boomtowns sprang up in the island’s far northeast, including in the rainforests of the Atsinanana, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Whole forests of rosewood logs floated down rivers to the sea, where exporters loaded them onto ships bound for Southeast Asia — by one estimate, more than a thousand shipping containers full of rosewood logs left the island that year. What had long been a trickle of precious wood from Madagascar had become a flood. Horrified by the destruction, a small group of scientists and environmentalists working in Madagascar began a campaign to expose the timber barons and the politicians behind them. “Our approach was to name and shame,” says Lucienne Wilmé, a biogeographer and research associate with the Missouri Botanical Garden in Madagascar. Working with an army of Malagasy informants, the group published reports in scientific journals, decried international shipping companies for their complicity, and eventually succeeded in catching the attention of the international media. In 2013, Madagascar’s transitional government bowed to rising international pressure and agreed to list all Malagasy rosewoods under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), a 1975 treaty that limits trade in such species. For the group, the listing was a major success. But CITES must rely on member countries for enforcement — a significant weakness. Soon after, the MV Oriental Pride arrived in Singapore, its hold piled high with rosewood logs. So long as the logs remained “in transit,” they legally weren’t in Singapore and therefore weren’t subject to seizure. According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, wildlife trafficking is the world’s fourth largest organized crime, behind drug trafficking, counterfeiting, and human trafficking. Siew Hong Wong, a Singaporean lawyer and private investigator who spent much of his career chasing counterfeiters, says these crimes naturally go together. “It’s transferable,” he says. “It’s the same skill set.” Wong joined Rakotoson in the case against the trafficker, the Singapore-based company Kong Hoo and its managing director, Wong Wee Keong. The run-up to the trial was marked by a series of baffling events. First, the defendants produced several letters signed by various employees of the Malagasy Ministry for Environment and Forestry authorizing Wong Wee Keong and a Malagasy partner, Zakaria Soilihi, to export 5,000 tons of rosewood. But Wong and Rakotoson discovered that the letters were doctored versions of much older documents authorizing exports of smaller quantities of pine, not rosewood. Then, Singaporean authorities received an email addressed from Madagascar’s director general of forests, stating that the rosewood exports were authorized and that the importers “should not encounter any problems.” But when an enforcement officer with the United Nations’ CITES Secretariat followed up, the director general wrote back that his account had been hacked, and that the authorization documents were fake. Wong and Rakotoson found that the bill of lading, too, was falsified. It stated that Oriental Pride had disembarked from the Malagasy port of Toamasina, on its eastern coast, but port authorities had no record of the ship, and satellite imagery suggested that it had departed instead from Madagascar’s northeast, source of most of the island’s prized rosewood. Rosewood logs at the port of Toamasina, Madagascar, after a coup in 2009 led to a logging boom. Babelon Pierre-Yves / Alamy Stock Photo Then, the Malagasy government stopped cooperating altogether — perhaps, the lawyers suggested, because some of its members also had financial stakes in the rosewood business. Madagascar is consistently ranked among the top fifth of the world’s most corrupt countries by watchdog groups like Transparency International. “The correlation between election cycles and rosewood trafficking intensity seems to be… an important factor to take into account to understand the current state of play in Madagascar,” wrote the Environmental Investigation Agency, a U.K.-based nonprofit, in a recent report . It pointed to the example of Erick Lambert Besoa, whom the agency’s sources said was one of the top timber barons responsible for the unprecedented deforestation following the 2009 coup. In 2021, Madagascar’s president nominated Besoa as a senator, then vice president of the country’s senate. Without the support of the Malagasy government, the case against the rosewood traffickers turned not on whether or not the rosewood was illegally harvested or trafficked, but on whether or not the traffickers intended Singapore as the logs’ final destination. It appeared that the traffickers intended to use one of Singapore’s port-side warehouses to package the logs, which were loose in the Oriental Pride ’s hold, into easier-to-handle shipping containers. Indeed, one of the prosecution’s witnesses testified that he’d booked 30 shipping containers for the logs on a Hong Kong-bound vessel. So long as the logs remained “in transit,” they legally weren’t in Singapore, and therefore weren’t subject to seizure under Singapore’s Endangered Species Act. Rosewoods are not “big mammals that we can all feel sorry for,” says a botanist who helped expose their destruction. In 2015, a judge acquitted the defendants, ruling that the rosewood shipment legally remained in transit, and had not been imported. On appeal, a High Court judge overturned the ruling, sending it back to the lower court. Again, the lower court acquitted the defendants. On a second appeal, a High Court judge overturned the acquittal, finding the defendants guilty of illegally importing rosewood into Singapore. He sentenced Wong Wee Keong to three months in jail and ordered him to pay a fine of 500,000 Singapore dollars. But then, in 2019, a five-judge panel at the Singapore Court of Appeal overturned the conviction and ordered the logs to be released to the traffickers. The saga of the Malagasy rosewood seized in Singapore is a small part of a much bigger story. While in the popular imagination trafficking in endangered species involves elephant ivory and rhino horns and tiger parts, rosewood is just as fitting a posterchild. A 2020 report from the U.N. estimated that rosewoods comprise more than 40 percent of the value of trafficked species seized between 2014 and 2018, more than elephants, rhinos, and big cats combined. During that same period, so-called forest crimes, which include not only poaching protected trees, but also illegal logging, were worth between $30 billion and $100 billion, according to another U.N. report ; as much as a third of the “legal” global timber trade involved illegally harvested wood, the report’s authors wrote. A shipment of rosewood logs is unloaded in Jiangsu, China. Lu Guang / Greenpeace To conservationists focused on saving rare and endangered plants, it is a familiar problem. “They’re not emblematic big mammals that we can all feel sorry for and hug and love,” says Pete Lowry. “This massive part of the illegal trade is simply not on anybody’s radar screen.” Lowry is a botanist and taxonomist with the Missouri Botanical Garden and was part of the group that helped expose the destruction of Madagascar’s rosewood forests following the 2009 coup. One of the difficulties in conserving threatened tree species is the distance between the living organism and the lumber it produces. “Rosewood,” for instance, is a description of a product, Lowry says, not of a single species or even a genus of tree. Along with the Malagasy and Southeast Asian rosewoods, there are also rosewoods native to mainland Africa and Central and South America. Some are related to Malagasy rosewoods, which belong to the genus Dalbergia , but others are barely cousins. Conservation laws and treaties tend to focus on individual species, which can lead to a kind of conservation Whac-A-Mole. In 2018, the CITES Standing Committee recommended a halt to trade in Nigerian “kosso,” a tree known in the lumber trade as “African rosewood” and taxonomically as Pterocarpus erinaceus , after an investigation found that Nigeria was permitting the export of far more of the CITES-listed tree than was likely sustainable. But lumber exporters from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Congo, and Mozambique helped take up the slack with a tree called “mukula,” or Pterocarpus tinctorius , also sold under the name “African rosewood.” In 2019, that species was also listed under CITES. The number of Malagasy rosewood species stands at more than 80, up from a couple of dozen before an effort to describe new species. Even after a species is listed under CITES or national conservation laws, the gap between organism and product remains a problem. Botanists typically identify species based on foliage and flowers, not logs or sawn lumber, criteria that conservationists say have often allowed traffickers to profess ignorance of the protected status of their wares. The challenge of wood identification is compounded by underlying taxonomic uncertainty. Conservationists pushed Madagascar to take the unusual step of listing all Malagasy members of Dalbergia under CITES, rather than individual species, simply because taxonomists had not yet described all of the species. Over the last several years, Lowry and other scientists embarked on an effort to fill that taxonomic gap, traveling across Madagascar to collect samples, eventually describing dozens of new species. The number of Malagasy rosewood species now stands at more than 80, up from just a couple dozen before the effort. Tendro Radanielina and Jenny Tahinarizaka Rakotonirina, botanists at the University of Antananarivo in Madagascar, are among a group of researchers now working to create a database that would allow rapid identification of Malagasy rosewoods based on either anatomical, chemical, or genetic traits. “The goal is to help Madagascar to have the tools of control,” Radanielina says. A Chinese artisan carves a piece of rosewood in Jiangsu, China. Lu Guang / Greenpeace There remains the puzzle of what to do with existing stocks of rosewood logs and lumber. Stockpiles of rosewood logs are scattered across Madagascar, containing as many as 2.26 million logs, according to the Environmental Investigation Agency . The Malagasy government has declared its possession of about a tenth of these stockpiles; the rest are undeclared or in the hands of the timber barons. In 2021, Madagascar announced that it planned to allow the domestic use of rosewood lumber from declared stockpiles, both in restoration and infrastructure projects, and by artisans, whose handiworks would be sold to international tourists. These tourists would be allowed to return home with as much as 10 kilograms, or roughly 22 pounds, of rosewood handiworks. Conservationists and anti-corruption organizations protested. Mark Roberts, an environmental lawyer who worked on the 2014 seizure case, says that a Malagasy domestic rosewood market could hurt conservation efforts far beyond Madagascar. “What if the southern African countries all of the sudden decide they’re going to have domestic trade in ivory or rhino horn?” he says. “Or China, which has tiger farms of endangered tigers, decides that they’re going to start a domestic trade in tiger skins? Permitting domestic trade of highly prized rare and endangered species could completely undermine CITES’ conservation efforts.” He suggested that Chinese furniture makers might even set up factories in Madagascar, making hongmu furniture components, which could be exported 10 kilograms at a time and assembled later. In 2021, Madagascar announced plans to allow the domestic use of rosewood lumber from declared stockpiles. Colmán Ó Criodáin, a botanist and wildlife policy manager at the World Wildlife Fund, agreed. “People might say, ‘Well, there’s an awful lot of poor people in Madagascar. Why can’t it help with that?’” But he says both the history of CITES-sanctioned ivory auctions, which occurred in 1999 and 2009, and of Madagascar’s rosewood trade suggest that any money earned would be concentrated in the hands of the wealthy. WWF’s position, he says, is that “under no circumstances, even domestically, should private individuals, be they government employees or anybody else, be able to profit from the domestic trade in this timber.” The fate of one particular stockpile — the logs seized in 2014 — remains in question. Singaporean law stipulates that since those logs legally remain “in transit,” once repossessed by the traffickers, they may remain in port only for 14 days. But to leave, they would need to provide Singaporean authorities with a CITES import permit from the receiving country, and CITES export documentation from Madagascar — unlikely, Rakotoson wrote in a memo, “because the wood was illegally smuggled out of Madagascar.” China’s government has announced that it would not accept the logs. The CITES Secretariat, meanwhile, issued a memo instructing its 184 signatory countries to seize the logs, leaving just a handful of countries as potential destinations. For now at least, the logs are stuck. Roberts, the environmental lawyer, says he heard that someone had recently inspected the logs, still sitting in the port-side warehouse, and that they were starting to attract termites. “On the one hand, it’s kind of, ‘Yay!” he says. “That’s kind of like burning the ivory. But on the other hand, if all of that wood is destroyed, that’s just that much more pressure to cut down the few remaining Malagasy rosewood trees.”","30,000 Madagascar rosewood logs, enough to cover two football fields 10 feet deep, were seized in Singapore. Rosewood can be worth as much as $1.5 million per cubic meter, according to a recent U.N. report. Madagascar’s government, meanwhile, is contemplating creating a legalized domestic trade in rosewood, a move critics say would undermine international conservation efforts. In 2009, protesters supported by the Malagasy army overthrew the government. In the chaos that followed, organized crime — what its opponents describe as “the Rosewood Mafia” — took full advantage of the surging demand.",http://res.cloudinary.com/drwsupfyj/image/upload/v1728704850/state-of-the-earth/news_photographs/howtraffickersgotawaywiththebiggestrosewoodheistinhistory.jpg

Pexels Renewable power is on pace to produce close to half of the electricity used globally by the end of this decade, according to a new report from the International Energy Agency, which finds that in nearly every country large wind and solar plants are the cheapest forms of new power. Between now and 2030, the world will add more than 5,500 gigawatts of renewable capacity — what amounts to the total current capacity of China, India, the U.S., and the EU combined, according to the report . Solar will account for most of the growth. “This report shows that the growth of renewables, especially solar, will transform electricity systems across the globe this decade,” said IEA chief Fatih Birol. Solar continues to outperform the projections of industry experts and is set to boom in the years ahead as manufacturing ramps up. India and the U.S. are both expected to triple their solar manufacturing capacity by the end of this decade, and manufacturing is already outstripping demand. By the end of this year solar manufacturing capacity, largely based in China, will be double the global demand. China continues to lead the way on renewable power installations, as it makes an aggressive push to erect massive new solar and wind projects. By decade’s end, China will account for nearly half of all renewable capacity globally, up from a third in 2010. If trends continue, the world will fall just shy of an international goal to triple renewable power by 2030. Analysts say that governments can speed the shift to clean energy and reach this goal by cutting red tape and by making it cheaper for poorer countries to finance wind and solar projects. Analysts say that governments must also build out power lines to carry renewable electricity from where it is generated to where it is needed.

1557,2024-10-03 10:35:00,Yale Environment 360,https://e360.yale.edu/features/richard-thompson-interview,Why We Need a Strong Global Agreement on Plastics Pollution,Public Health & Environment,Sustainability,"When marine biologist Richard Thompson and his students analyzed samples of beach sand over 20 years ago, they were surprised to find countless small multicolored pieces of plastic mixed in. Thompson, a professor at the University of Plymouth, dubbed the fragments “microplastics” and published the first-ever paper on the subject in Science magazine in 2004. Since that landmark study, more than 7,000 papers have come out about microplastics, including one coauthored by Thompson that was published in Science last month and warned that the tiny particles pose a growing biological threat to many species, including humans. The rate of global plastic production has roughly doubled in the last two decades. Without action at a global level, Thompson has written , plastic production could triple by 2060. “Nobody’s saying there’s no safe way to use plastics” he said in an interview with Yale Environment 360 . “It’s just that we need to start making them to be safer and more sustainable than we have done so far.” Thompson says he hopes that negotiators at the international plastics treaty conference in Busan, South Korea, next month will heed warnings from scientists like him about the growing dangers of microplastics and act decisively on the problem before it is too late. Microplastics pcess609 / iStock Yale Environment 360: How did you first become interested in microplastics? Richard Thompson: I was conducting experiments on the shore that were accumulating lots of little pieces of plastic. I mobilized the students, and we organized beach cleans. I started asking the question, “What are the smallest pieces?” My students went out on the beach, and they brought back samples of sand. When we looked at them with a microscope, we saw pieces that didn’t look like sand, that turned out to be plastic. We discovered that microplastics, including many smaller than the diameter of a human hair, contaminated waters around the U.K. In a 2004 paper published in Science, we showed that they were biologically available to a range of marine organisms. We also showed, using archived samples, that the abundance of these small fragments, which we named microplastics, had increased significantly since the 1960s. e360: We’ve known about plastic pollution for a long time. Why did it take so long for scientists to look into this question of microplastics? Thompson: There were some studies of plastic pollution in the 1960s and 70s. But nobody was recording small bits. And it wasn’t until our 2004 paper that this really started to attract attention. I suppose it was kind of out of sight, out of mind, particularly for what I was describing, which was truly microscopic. You wouldn’t have been able to see it without a microscope. e360: Did you immediately sense how important a discovery was? Thompson: Probably not. I mean, I thought it was important enough to submit to Science . When I got back from holiday [after the paper was published,] my computer was full of media inquiries. Almost nothing else that morning. The phone was ringing constantly. “The predictions are that we’ll see wide-scale ecological harm from the microplastics in the next 70 to 100 years.” Since then, we’ve looked from Mount Everest down to the deep sea, from the poles to the equator. We’ve found this material everywhere. I recently came back from a major scientific conference [ MICRO 2024 in Lanzarote, Spain] just about microplastics. I would never have dreamt of that 20 years ago. There were 700 scientists from all around the world registered at the conference just to discuss microplastics. So interest has grown phenomenally. e360: In your latest paper, you cite polls that show that people rate plastic pollution as a more pressing issue for the oceans than climate change. How do you account for that? Thompson: The [microplastics] problem is going to be irreversible. And the predictions are that we’ll see wide-scale ecological harm from microplastics in the next 70 to 100 years. We’ve already got clear evidence of ecological harm. They’re not going to degrade, they’re persistent contaminants. And because of their small size, it’s going to be kind of irreversible. So I don’t know, have the public got that level of concern right or wrong? Climate change is a major issue that we need to grapple with. I’d argue that maybe tackling the problem of plastic pollution, although incredibly complex is, I’m hesitant to say, simpler. I would argue that a lot of the societal benefits that we get from plastics could be realized without the harm by starting to use plastics more sustainably. We’ve failed to design plastics [for recycling and reuse] for example. So that’s part of the problem with producing colossal quantities, well over 400 million tons of plastic every year, 40 percent of it is destined for single use. Yale Environment 360 e360: There are a lot of different sources of these microplastics. Do we know what the main ones are? Thompson: The biggest source overall accounting for about two-thirds of all microplastics is the larger items of litter that are accumulating in the environment. The packets, the bottles, all of those things will fragment over time into smaller and smaller pieces. There are also fragments and fibers that wear away from larger items like car tires and clothing. The other third is direct emissions of small pieces to the environment. For example, the small bits of plastic that are intentionally added to products such as cosmetics and paints. e360: You are a marine biologist. A lot of attention has been paid to the question of microplastics ending up in the ocean. After 7,000-plus studies, what do we now know about the impact on the ocean ecosystem? Thompson: Well, it’s clear that microplastics are incredibly biologically available to a wide range of creatures. I think well over 1,000 species have been shown to ingest them. And there’s clear evidence of harm to individuals. There are also experiments that demonstrate effects on communities and also on ecosystem services, things like gas exchange between sediment and seawater. So we’re seeing evidence of harm across all levels of biological organization, from cellular to ecosystem. “We can’t wait for all these studies [on plastics and human health] to the done before we take action.’ e360: I’ve read that microplastics have been found even in plankton and algae. Is there any evidence that, as with heavy metals like mercury, they accumulate as they go higher up in the food chain? Thompson: Good question. No, there’s not. There’s evidence of transfer along food chain, but there isn’t biomagnifcation as we see with mercury, for example, from the best evidence that we’ve got at the moment. Now, where I think we may see a change to that is as we start to work on smaller and smaller particles. e360: Are these very tiny particles even more dangerous than the larger ones which, when they are ingested, generally just pass through the digestive system and get excreted out? Thompson: The scientific consensus is yes, they are, because they’re not only going to go into the gut, they’re going to pass into the circulatory system. The gut handles foreign material from time to time. It’s a barrier in its own right. But once we’re inside the circulatory system in organisms, then I’d say the potential is quite different. So I think small is certainly more biologically available. Plastic pollution in the Buriganga River in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Munir Uz Zaman / AFP via Getty Images e360: There have been reports that say that the quantities of plastics entering the environment far exceed the quantities we’re actually finding in the environment. Where are these missing plastics as they call them? Thompson: Yeah, this question of the missing plastics, it’s interesting. Back in 2004 when I published that first paper, I entitled it “Lost At Sea: Where Is All The Plastic?” Because what I did not see at that time in any of the data that was coming from beach cleans was the increase in abundance that you might expect to see. And neither did I see it from surface trawl data. But the reason I believe is that we weren’t yet recording the small bits, so we were missing a fraction. And also there are sinks, places of accumulation that we’re not yet looking at. The deep sea looks like it’s got a lot in it, but we don’t have all that much data from it. e360: So potentially, just like we have the Pacific garbage patch, there could also be places where these microplastics are accumulating in the ocean? Thompson: Yes, that’s right. There are surface gyres, but I think the deep sea is also really quite a big sink. We’ve got some data there to illustrate quite high concentrations, indeed concentrations higher than in sediments close to some cities. The deep sea is downhill from everywhere, if you like. e360: Microplastics are also found on land and in the air. I understand that their level in indoor air is often extremely high. Is that right? Thompson: Yes, a key source is fibers from textiles, and that’s our clothing, It’s carpets. It’s curtaining. When three similar items of clothing were tested, we got up to an 80 percent difference in the rate of release. So it’s clear there are interventions that could be made at the design stage to really reduce this microfiber shedding. “There’s a whole range of plastic items that actually we could live without, and I think we’re going to need to.” e360: Where do microplastics show up in the human body? Do we find them in the blood, in the organs? Thompson: In our latest paper, there are 20-odd different references to accumulation in the human body that we point to. Do we have the science budgets to spend billions further drilling down into human health? Have we got two decades to pursue that? I mean, we don’t know when the strongest evidence around human health might emerge. It could be tomorrow. It could be 20 years. It might cost billions. We can’t wait for all these studies to the done before we take action. If we’ve already decided it’s harmful, wouldn’t it be better to invest those limited science budgets in exploring where microplastics are and how to eliminate them? e360: What do we need to do to begin to solve this problem? Thompson: I call them the three R’s — reduce, reuse, recycle. So we need to start with primary polymer reduction. There’s a whole range of plastic items that actually we could live without, and I think we’re going to need to. It includes single-use plastic bags given away at checkouts. it includes single-use cups. It includes microbeads in cosmetics, We need to make sure the products we’re making are essential to society. Microplastic fibers can be seen inside a larval lobster. Madelyn Woods e360: What about the reuse and recycle? Thompson: Increasing the use of reusable containers could be a key strategy here. To date, very little has been designed with recycling in mind. Recycling rates globally are less than 10 percent. If product design and waste management had gotten together decades ago, we would be in a stronger place now. We’re also going to need transparency of labeling to ensure that chemicals of concern are listed. And we need to simplify [the composition of] chemicals in plastics to make them safer and to make them of more circular [reusable] materials. e360: This would require regulations on a global scale. Is the world ready for that? Thompson: We’re going to need a science body attached to the U.N. treaty to help to guide us through all of that in a way that’s independent of conflicts of interests. It’s very different to the discussions that we had with industry over tobacco smoking, for example, where it was clear there was no safe way to smoke. Nobody’s saying there’s no safe way to use plastics. It’s just that we need to start making them to be safer and more sustainable than we have done so far. And that’s what the treaty needs to help us do. And it’s a frustration to me. We could be in a much stronger place if industry had maybe embraced that voluntarily a bit earlier. The global plastics pollution treaty is a vehicle to getting us there. The next step, of course, is the negotiations in Busan in November, and the challenge is going to be getting all of the nations to agree on that treaty. “I would hope the major [companies] deliver their products in packaging compatible with the local waste management system.” e360: That’s the plastic treaty negotiation in South Korea in November. So what kind of outcome would you like to see come from that meeting? Thompson: Well, we need to see an agreement. And at the moment, there’s a lot of disagreement. And that’s understandable because like anything, there’s going to be winners and losers, so people are going to disagree. Since, the primary carbon source for plastics is petroleum, the major fossil oil and gas producers also see a concern for them. And, of course, some countries might want to strike some things out of the treaty that could be in my view be really important. So we’re going to have to hope that this lands in the right place. So far, it’s been frustrating to see the lack of consensus among nations about how to address this global problem. e360: What can we do as individuals? Thompson: Of course, you can try to refuse single-use items. You can try to take a reusable bag with you. You can try to take a refillable coffee cup. You can do what you can to make plastic items last and use them as long as possible. Beyond that, we’re really going to need better design. I mean, if we look to a supermarket of the future, say in 10 years’ time, I would hope that the major brands, producers, and retailers deliver their products in packaging that is compatible with the local waste management system. We need to create clothing that sheds less particles, fishing gear and agricultural plastics that are safer. That’s where the real responsibility lies. It’s not about consumers having to agonize over minute labels on products that have been poorly designed. I’d like that responsibility to be lifted from the consumer.

1813,2024-10-01 10:59:00,Yale Environment 360,https://e360.yale.edu/features/navajo-natural-infrastructure-dryland-streams,"On Navajo Lands, Ancient Ways Are Restoring the Parched Earth",Climate Change,Sustainability,"Here in Burnt Corn Valley, smack in the middle of the Navajo reservation’s vast Black Mesa region, the hilly land both craves water and is brutalized by it. The sandy Arizona soil cracks under a punishing August sun as red-striped blister beetles search for moisture across its baked surface. Cottonwood trees and sagebrush rise from deep gullies carved by floodwaters that, during the intensifying summer monsoon, sluice off surrounding mesas and wash away fragile topsoil — reminders that with climate change, even quenching rains harbor powers of destruction. This portrait of climatic havoc belies a softer reality, though. Farming once thrived in this parched region and could once again — if the right practices are adopted. Exhibit A: The crops on Roberto Nutlouis’s 12-acre Sliding Rock Farm, in his reservation hometown of Piñon, a five-hour drive north of Phoenix. “The corn is actually pretty big and thriving,” Nutlouis says. He believes — and both Western science and the lived experience of his Native elders affirm — that the traditional rock and stick structures he’s built on his property, which help store water and prevent erosion, have a lot to do with it. These structures, similar to those used by Native peoples long before Europeans arrived on the continent, are not only delivering water to crops (the broader, 27,000-square-mile reservation has the highest reported rate of food insecurity in the U.S.). They are also restoring Nutlouis’s watershed and those of his neighbors, helping to sequester carbon, and reviving this high-desert ecosystem. It’s all part of a bigger effort among a range of local and regional grassroots organizations to build back the reservation’s fragile, depleted ecosystems and bring greater sovereignty over food, water, and health to its communities. People living in arid zones have long used structures made of naturally occurring materials to capture water for crops. Diné (the Navajo name for themselves) are well aware that climate change is making the weather on their semi-arid plateau weirder, wilder, and more destructive. Depending on elevation, precipitation in Black Mesa averages 6 to 16 inches a year; recent heat extremes — the Navajo government declared a state of emergency in 2023 due to soaring temperatures —mean that the scant water evaporates more quickly. Climate models predict the region will experience increasing droughts that decimate plant life, part of a growing trend of human-caused desertification across the globe, as well as higher-intensity seasonal rainfall, which can sweep away crops and roads. The ecological health of the reservation has also been weakened by deforestation from timbering operations and from overgrazing over the years. Still, this season, Nutlouis, 44, has been able to skip his usual two-hour roundtrip drive to a reliable well to haul water home for his corn. His crop is healthy and hydrated because his land still holds last winter’s snowmelt. Clearly, his heavy labor over the past 20 years — during which he has built woven brush dams, gabions (wirework cages filled with rocks), earthen berms, concrete spillways and trenches, limestone aprons and walls, and stone-lined “Zuni bowls,” which stabilize eroding streambeds — is paying off. Roberto Nutlouis. Courtesy of Roberto Nutlouis Diné and others living in arid zones around the world have long used structures made of naturally occurring materials to capture and control water to grow crops and to mitigate the devastation of floods in ephemeral stream systems. Various Puebloans, including Zuni and Hohokam, used similar devices, as did the Aztecs. Arab peoples and tribes in India have incorporated stone water diversions for thousands of years. “[M]ost traditional Indigenous communities are not passive observers of nature,” writes Lyla June Johnston, a Diné anthropologist and community organizer. Instead, they are “influential facilitators of landscape scale abundance, rooted in an ethic of kinship and reverence.” Time and again over the last 15 years, Laura Norman, a research scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey, has seen evidence that when these structures — which Norman calls Natural Infrastructure in Dryland Streams, or NIDS — are placed in gullies, they slow water to mitigate erosion, collect nutrient-rich sediment and plant debris that nourish both crops and wild plants, help store carbon, improve groundwater recharge, and increase downstream water availability by as much as 28 percent . “It’s a snowball effect that counters degradation, and you get all of these ecosystem services,” she says. The structures on Nutlouis’s farm are integral cogs in a larger system of floodplain farming. It works like this: Nutlouis’s property lies in an alluvial fan , where mineral-rich sediments and plant waste atop mesas and other uplands wash down onto flatter ground with rainwater, snowmelt, and spring water. Across the valley, similar farms rely on this kind of system, many of which feature stone and stick constructions that Nutlouis helped build. The organic materials trapped behind the structures, says Jonathan Sandor, an emeritus agronomy professor at Iowa State University, “are a major input into keeping the fertility of the soils up.” Such small watersheds are optimal: “These gentle slopes and small watersheds allow runoff but reduce the possibility of high runoff velocities that may damage crops,” Sandor explained in a 2008 paper . “Even tiny little one-rock dams can make big changes on the landscape,” says an expert. Whether rock walls or ramps, hand-dug depressions in the soil, earthen walls, or branches plaited into dams, NIDS splash water over a wider area and slow its flow so it can better soak into the soil. Many trap sediments behind them, fertilizing whatever grows nearby. The stone structures create a hyperlocal cooling effect , especially when they’re combined with shade-making vegetation. Here, too, smallness is a boon. “Even tiny little one-rock dams can make big changes on the landscape,” Norman says. Up to five kilometers downstream from such structures, “we’ve documented increased vegetation despite drought. We’ve also documented [increased vegetation] up to one kilometer upstream, which indicates water availability.” In this way, an alluvial farm and its NIDS can support plants both sown and wild. “The moisture we get from winter precipitation is really important for the corn to germinate and grow,” says Nutlouis, “and the monsoon rain is really important to finish our harvest of corn and squash and melons.” He acknowledges that in practice this can look chaotic, with cornfields flooded up to their ears before the water trickles down to the next field. Workers construct a rock apron to slow the flow of stream water and stem erosion. Roberto Nutlouis But lately, climate change has thrown extra challenges at the reservation. “There’s a serious soil moisture deficit that’s causing a lot of ecological shifts,” Nutlouis says. Much of Black Mesa’s pinyon forest, he says, has succumbed to two decades of drought. Historically, Diné have foraged for pinyon pine nuts. They are an important component of food sovereignty on the reservation, and their loss is acutely felt. But the ecosystem services provided by Nutlouis’s structures on his farm and elsewhere do seem to be meeting those climatic challenges. He’s noticed small juniper trees popping up on hillsides around his property despite the dryness; A cottonwood tree towering over one cornfield is also lush and full. “The idea that Earth will restore itself with natural seed dispersal” after NIDS begin to do their job “has been my observation,” says Norman. Or as Nutlouis puts it, “We’re allowing nature to do its own thing and restore itself.” Still, Nutlouis is inclined to help the process along. His nonprofit Nihikeya (loosely translated as a collective ecological footprint) collaborates with a variety of local and regional grassroots groups that work on food, water, and justice issues, like Tolani Lake Enterprises , First Nations Development Institute , and the Ten Tribes Partnership . Diné C.A.R.E. , another collaborator, is an environmental justice organization that advocates for community health and land rights across the reservation, as well as for the cleanup of coal- and uranium-polluted rivers and aquifers. “We especially want to support a lot of renewable projects through solar and wind, and we want to support agriculture too, because having a robust food system is a form of revenue for local farmers,” says executive director Robyn Jackson. “It also helps with continuing our cultural traditions.” “We understand that rebuilding watersheds is going to be key to farming into the future,” says a Navajo activist. Nihikeya also works closely with the water-rights organization Tó Nizhóní Ání , whose members are collecting native plant seeds to restore riparian habitat across Black Mesa. Some of those native plants, like wolfberry, are edible, which will also help improve food sovereignty and security. “We understand that rebuilding watersheds is going to be key to continuing farming into the future,” says Tó Nizhóní Ání executive director Nicole Horseherder. To house accessions of pinyon and juniper, willow, wolfberry bush, three-leaf sumac, and rabbit brush, Nutlouis is building a seed bank. When put back into the landscape, these plants will help keep the ground moist and mitigate erosion. Nutlouis is working on his master’s degree in sustainable communities at Northern Arizona University, where he studies the Western science that qualifies and quantifies the benefits of traditional practices. But he is also adamant that watershed restoration success is predicated on reforging ancestral kinship connections — that is, on returning the power to make land-use decisions to clan mothers, who were traditionally Diné leaders in this arena. To that end, he’s been meeting with neighbors in one tiny watershed of Burnt Corn Valley after another to discuss how to improve the health of their land, whether for growing corn or just ensuring roads remain intact when it rains. So far, Nutlouis has helped restore 56 fields across the valley, with more NIDS than he can count. Roberto Nutlouis' farm. Roberto Nutlouis “If we can meet with all of these families [in the valley], and show them aerial maps… we can come up with a watershed development plan” for each of them, he says. “Then we can use that as a template as to how we’re going to organize with the community in the next watershed.” Improving multiple small watersheds in this way may lead to a cooler regional climate and greater water availability for all, says Norman. One of her NIDS study sites saw its water availability extended from three months to four months. “You can envision how important that is for arid lands,” she says. “We’ve been doing this kind of farming way before the Europeans came, and that’s what our ancestors were known for,” says Nutlouis. “The work we do is looking back at ancestral wisdom, reclaiming and re-correcting knowledge, de-colonizing and re-Indigenizing.” He continues, “Ecologies needs to be restored. Food systems need to be restored. This is an opportunity to begin developing localized food economies. There’s a lot of potential in that, but we got to do it right.” Reporting for this piece was supported by a media fellowship from the Nova Institute for Health.","The Navajo reservation has the highest reported rate of food insecurity in the U.S. Diné are well aware that climate change is making the weather on their semi-arid plateau weirder, wilder, and more destructive.

2197,2024-09-26 13:28:00,Yale Environment 360,https://e360.yale.edu/features/taiwan-energy-dilemma,Why Taiwan and Its Tech Industry Are Facing an Energy Crisis,Energy,Sustainability,"Some 50 miles southwest of Taipei, Taiwan’s capital, and strategically located close to a cluster of the island’s top universities, the 3,500-acre Hsinchu Science Park is globally celebrated as the incubator of Taiwan’s most successful technology companies. It opened in 1980, the government having acquired the land and cleared the rice fields, with the aim of creating a technology hub that would combine advanced research and industrial production. Today Taiwan’s science parks house more than 1,100 companies, employ 321,000 people, and generate $127 billion in annual revenue. Along the way, Hsinchu Science Park’s Industrial Technology Research Institute has given birth to startups that have grown into world leaders. One of them, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), produces at least 90 percent of the world’s most advanced computer chips. Collectively, Taiwan’s companies hold a 68 percent market share of all global chip production. It is a spectacular success. But it has also created a problem that could threaten the future prosperity of both the sector and the island. As the age of energy-hungry artificial intelligence dawns, Taiwan is facing a multifaceted energy crisis: It depends heavily on imported fossil fuels; It has ambitious clean energy targets that it is failing to meet; And it can barely keep up with current demand. Addressing this problem, government critics say, is growing increasingly urgent. By 2030, Taiwan’s semiconductor industry will consume twice as much electricity as the whole of New Zealand. Taiwan’s more than 23 million people consume nearly as much energy per capita as U.S. consumers, but the lion’s share of that consumption — 56 percent — goes to Taiwan’s industrial sector for companies like TSMC. In fact, TSMC alone uses around 9 percent of Taiwan’s electricity. One estimate by Greenpeace has suggested that by 2030 Taiwan’s semiconductor manufacturing industry will consume twice as much electricity as did the whole of New Zealand in 2021; The bulk of that enormous energy demand, about 82 percent the report suggests, will come from TSMC. Taiwan’s government is banking on the continuing success of its technology sector and wants the island to be a leader in A.I. But just one small data center, the Vantage 16MW Data center in Taipei, is expected to require as much energy as some 13,000 households. Nicholas Chen, a lawyer who analyses Taiwan’s climate and energy policies, warns that the collision of Taiwan’s commitments to the clean energy transition and its position in global supply chains as a key partner of multinational companies that have made commitments to net-zero deadlines — along with the explosive growth in demand — has all the makings of a crisis. “In order to plan and operate A.I. data centers, an adequate supply of stable, zero-carbon energy is a precondition,” he said. “A.I. data centers cannot exist without sufficient green energy. Taiwan is the only government talking about A.I. data center rollout without regard to the lack of green energy.” An offshore wind turbine in the Taiwan Strait. Billy H.C. Kwok / Bloomberg via Getty Images It is not just a case of building more capacity. Taiwan’s energy dilemma is a combination of national security, climate, and political challenges. The island depends on imported fossil fuel for around 90 percent of its energy and lives under the growing threat of blockade, quarantine, or invasion from China. In addition, for political reasons, the government has pledged to close its nuclear sector by 2025. Taiwan regularly attends U.N. climate meetings, though never as a participant. Excluded at China’s insistence from membership in the United Nations, Taiwan asserts its presence on the margins, convening side events, and adopting the Paris Agreement targets of peak emissions before 2030 and achieving net zero by 2050. Its major companies, TSMC included, have signed up to RE100 , a corporate renewable energy initiative, and pledged to achieve net zero production. But right now, there is a wide gap between aspiration and performance. Angelica Oung, a journalist and founder of the Clean Energy Transition Alliance, a nonprofit that advocates for a rapid energy transition, has studied Taiwan’s energy sector for years. When we met in a restaurant in Taipei, she cheerfully ordered an implausibly large number of dishes that crowded onto the small table as we talked. Oung described two major blackouts — one in 2021 that affected TSMC and 6.2 million households for five hours, and one in 2022 that affected 5.5 million households. It is a sign, she says, of an energy system running perilously close to the edge. Taiwan’s fossil fuels are imported by sea, leaving it vulnerable to both price fluctuations and blockade by China. Nicholas Chen argues that government is failing to keep up even with existing demand. “In the past eight years there have been four major power outages,” he said, and “brownouts are commonplace.” The operating margin on the grid — the buffer between supply and demand — ought to be 25 percent in a secure system. In Taiwan, Oung explained, there have been several occasions this year when the margin was down to 5 percent. “It shows that the system is fragile,” she said. Taiwan’s current energy mix illustrates the scale of the challenge: Last year, Taiwan’s power sector was 83 percent dependent on fossil fuel: Coal accounted for around 42 percent of generation; natural gas 40 percent; and oil 1 percent. Nuclear supplied 6 percent, and solar, wind, hydro, and biomass together, nearly 10 percent, according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Taiwan’s fossil fuels are imported by sea, which leaves the island at the mercy both of international price fluctuations and potential blockade by China. The government has sought to shield consumers from rising global prices, but that has resulted in growing debt for the Taiwan Electric Power Company (Taipower), the national provider. In the event of a naval blockade by China, Taiwan could count on about six weeks reserves of coal but not much more than a week of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Given that LNG supplies more than a third of electricity generation, the impacts would be severe.  The government has announced ambitious energy targets. The 2050 net-zero roadmap released by Taiwan’s National Development Council in 2022 promised to shut down its nuclear sector by 2025. By the same year, the share of coal would have to come down to 30 percent, gas would have to rise to 50 percent, and renewables would have to leap to 20 percent. None of those targets is on track. Progress on renewables has been slow for a number of reasons, according to Oung. “The problem with solar in Taiwan is that we don’t have a big area. We have the same population as Australia and use same amount of electricity, but we are only half the size of Tasmania and 79 percent of Taiwan is mountainous, so land acquisition is difficult.” Rooftop solar is expensive and roof space is sometimes needed for other things, such as helicopter pads, public utilities, or water tanks. According to Peter Kurz, a consultant to the technology sector and a long-term resident of Taiwan, there is one renewable resource that the nation has in abundance. “The Taiwan Strait has a huge wind resource,” he said. “It is the most wind power anywhere in the world available close to a population.” Government critics regard the pledge to shut down Taiwan’s remaining nuclear reactor as needless self-harm. Offshore wind is under development, but the government is criticized for imposing burdensome requirements to use Taiwanese products and workers that the country is not well equipped to meet. They reflect the government’s ambition to build a native industry at the same time as addressing its energy problem. But critics point out that Taiwan lacks the specialist industrial skills that producing turbines demands, and the requirements lead to higher costs and delays. Despite the attraction of Taiwan’s west coast with its relatively shallow waters, there are other constraints, such as limited harbor space. There is also another concern that is unique to Taiwan’s geography: The west side of the island faces China, and there are continuing incursions into Taiwan’s territorial waters from China’s coast guard and navy vessels. Offshore wind turbines are within easy rocket and missile range from China, and undersea energy cables are highly vulnerable. Government critics regard one current policy as needless self-harm: the pledge to shut down Taiwan’s remaining nuclear reactor by next year and achieve a “nuclear free homeland.” It is a pledge made by the current ruling party, the Democratic People’s Party (DPP) and, as the deadline approaches, it is a policy increasingly being questioned. Taiwan’s civil nuclear program was started under the military dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek’s KMT party with half an eye on developing a nuclear weapons program. Taiwan built its first experimental facility in the 1950s and opened its first power plant in 1978. The DPP came into existence in 1986, the year of the Chernobyl disaster, and its decision to adopt a no-nuclear policy was reinforced by the Fukushima disaster in neighboring Japan in 2011. A protest against restarting shuttered nuclear plants in Tapei last April. I-HWA Cheng / AFP via Getty Images “I think the DPP see nuclear energy as a symbol of authoritarianism,” said Oung, “so they oppose it.” Of Taiwan’s six nuclear reactors, three are now shut down, two have not been brought online, and the one functioning unit is due to close next year. The shuttered reactors have not yet been decommissioned, possibly because, in addition to its other difficulties, Taiwan has run out of waste storage capacity: The fuel rods remain in place because there is nowhere else to put them. As some observers see it, politics have got in the way of common sense: In 2018, a majority opposed the nuclear shutdown in a referendum, but the government continues to insist that its policy will not change. Voters added to the confusion in 2021 when they opposed the completion of the two uncommissioned plants. On the 13th floor of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Taipei, the deputy director general of Taiwan’s energy administration, Stephen Wu, chose his words carefully. “There is a debate going on in our parliament,” he said, “because the public has demanded a reduction of nuclear power and also a reduction in carbon emissions. So there is some discussion about whether the [shuttered] nuclear plants will somehow function again when conditions are ready.” If Taiwan does not accelerate clean energy deployment, companies will be obliged to leave the island, an analyst warns. Wu acknowledged that Taiwan was nudging against the limits of its current supply and that new entrants to Taiwan’s science and technology parks have to be carefully screened for their energy needs. But he took an optimistic view of Taiwan’s capacity to sustain A.I. development. “We assess energy consumption of companies to ensure the development of these companies complies with environmental protection,” he said. “In Singapore, data centers are highly efficient. We will learn from Singapore.” Critics of the government’s energy policy are not reassured. Chen has an alarming message: If Taiwan does not radically accelerate its clean energy development, he warns, companies will be obliged to leave the island. They will seek zero-carbon operating environments to comply with the net-zero requirements of partners such as Amazon, Meta, and Google, and to avoid carbon-based trade barriers such as the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. “Wind and solar are not scalable sources of zero-carbon energy,” he said. “Nuclear energy is the only scalable, zero-carbon source of energy. But the current laws state that foreign investment in nuclear energy must be capped at 50 percent, with the remaining 50 percent owned by Taipower. Given that Taipower is broke, how could a private investor want to partner with them and invest in Taiwan?” Chinese military helicopters in the Taiwan Strait, August 2022. Hector Retamal / AFP via Getty Images Chen argues that Taiwan should encourage private nuclear development and avoid the burdensome regulation that, he says, is hampering wind development. For Kurz, Taiwan’s energy security dilemma requires an imaginative leap. “Cables [carrying offshore wind energy] are vulnerable but replaceable,” he says. “Centralized nuclear is vulnerable to other risks, such as earthquakes.” One solution, he believes, lies in small modular nuclear reactors that could even be moored offshore and linked with undersea cables. It is a solution that he believes the Taiwan’s ruling party might come around to. There is a further security question to add to Taiwan’s complex challenges. The island’s circumstances are unique: It is a functioning democracy, a technological powerhouse, and a de facto independent country that China regards as a breakaway province to be recovered — if necessary, by force. The fact that its technology industry is essential for global production of everything from electric vehicles to ballistic missiles has counted as a security plus for Taiwan in its increasingly tense stand-off with China. It is not in the interest of China or the United States to see semiconductor manufacturers damaged or destroyed. Such companies, in security jargon, are collectively labelled Taiwan’s “silicon shield,” a shield the government is keen to maintain. That the sector depends inescapably on Taiwan’s energy security renders the search for a solution all the more urgent.","Taiwan depends heavily on imported fossil fuels; It has ambitious clean energy targets that it is failing to meet; And it can barely keep up with current demand.

A major barrier to meeting that goal, or surpassing it, analysts say, is the speed of permitting wind and solar projects and of building new transmission lines. At the U.N. climate conference last year, nearly 200 countries agreed to a goal of tripling renewable capacity by 2030. Analyses from Bloomberg New Energy Finance and the International Energy Agency find this goal is within reach. The cost of wind and, particularly, solar has fallen precipitously, boosting the renewable buildout. But to hasten the shift away from fossil fuels, governments must trim lengthy permitting processes, add energy storage, and erect transmission lines that can ferry renewable power from where it is produced to where it is needed. “It often takes as long or longer to obtain permits and licenses for large-scale renewable energy projects as it does to build them,” the IEA said in its report. It called on countries to simplify permitting. In Germany, where the government recently streamlined the approval process for renewable energy, wind and solar installations have nearly doubled. The IEA also called for adding 1,500 gigawatts of storage by the end of this decade, more than the total power capacity of the U.S., and for building or upgrading more than 15 million miles of power lines worldwide. In industrialized countries, “nothing else will matter as much” as upgrading the power grid, Generation Investment Management, a green investment firm, said in a recent report . But doing so, it said, “involves slow, cumbersome bureaucratic procedures.” In the U.S., one transmission project, which will link wind farms in Wyoming to cities in the West, languished in permitting for 18 years before breaking ground last year. In a new report on solar power, energy think tank Ember said that the constraint on future growth “is unlikely to come from solar panel prices.” The key, it said, “will be to ensure that countries have sufficient grid capacity to transport power to where it is needed, as well as develop battery storage capacity to complement solar outside of the sunniest hours.” ALSO ON YALE E360 Why Taiwan and Its Tech Industry Are Facing an Energy Crisis","Nearly 200 countries agreed to a goal of tripling renewable capacity by 2030.

Fernando Tornos Arroyo Scientists have found that some extinct volcanoes, which have not erupted for thousands or millions of years, may contain key metals used in clean energy. For the research, scientists melted down rocks similar to those found in extinct volcanoes that are rich in iron, discovering the rocks likely contained rare-earth elements, such as neodymium, that are used in wind turbines and electric car motors. “Our findings suggest that these iron-rich extinct volcanoes across the globe, such as El Laco in Chile, could be studied for the presence of rare-earth elements,” said Michael Anenburg, of the Australian National University, who coauthored the research. While so-called rare-earth elements are actually fairly common , they are scarcely found in their pure form and are generally difficult to refine. The new study, published in Geochemical Perspectives Letters , suggests that the rare-earths lurking under extinct volcanoes may be may be easier to extract. The iron-rich magma that formed some extinct volcanoes would be up to 100 times more efficient at concentrating rare-earths than the magma found in active volcanoes today.

Raindrops. Blood. Snowmelt. Ashes. Hope. Pesticides. Ink. (When the Mongols plundered Baghdad in 1258 A.D., they tossed so many books from the city’s libraries into the Tigris that the currents ran black with ink.) Dreams. Stories. Time. The photographer Murat Yazar understands this. He knows that rivers are the biographers of landscape. That they cradle within their currents a swirling distillation of every incident and anecdote that has transpired in the inhabited landscapes they course through. And few rivers carry a headier and more sobering brew of history — tales of human woe and triumph — than the Tigris and Euphrates, the fabled waterways that pour through the heartlands of Eurasian civilization, through the Fertile Crescent, from their chilly headwaters in the mountains of Turkey through vast watersheds in Syria, Kuwait, and Iran, to finally empty into Persian Gulf at the sweltering marshland shores of Iraq. Ten years ago, I walked with Yazar along the banks of Tigris at the antique settlement of Hasankeyf in Turkey. A local shepherd named Çoban Ali Ayhan sang for us there an old ballad that was more like a cry of pure agony. His voice bounded down the sandstone canyons of the Tigris, with a song that was a hymn to true love, which is to say, to love unrequited. It was an ode to loneliness, to waiting, to the exquisite suffering of betrayal. In other words: the perfect song for both the ancient riverbed and its doomed town, which would soon disappear under the reservoir of yet another massive government dam. The caverns of Hasankeyf , once lit by the campfires of the Neolithic, as well as nearby ruins of fortress walls, ornate minarets, and cliff-top citadels — a unique trove of architectural wonders that had seen the passing of Roman legionnaires and Silk Road caravans, some 12,000 years of memory — were soon to be erased. Yale Environment 360 “What can we do?” Ayhan glumly told us. “We opposed the dam. It is going ahead anyway.” Today, the place is underwater. In his documentary photography project “Lost Paradise,” Yazar presents us with the human and environmental costs of this massive reengineering of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Turkey. Yazar’s perspective is always local. He is an ethnic Kurd from Şanlıurfa, Turkey, and the son of generations of shepherds; for him the human connections to this landscape of his childhood are sacred. The construction of hundreds of dams, canals, weirs, and diversion projects big and small are changing his homeland literally beyond recognition. Turkish authorities insist that the millions of tons of poured concrete for these river developments are essential for agricultural self-sufficiency, for irrigation, and the hydropower needed to help reduce the country’s dependency on foreign energy. But Yazar captures a pastoral Mesopotamia — “the land between two rivers” — being rapidly transformed by inundation, relocated villages, extensive mining projects, deteriorating water quality, and drastic climate change . The two life-giving rivers that long sustained the region’s varied cultures are being throttled. While working on this project in Iraq near the Turkish border this summer, Murat was arrested by Kurdish security forces, who confiscated his camera and detained him for nine days. Back when I hiked the banks of the Tigris with Yazar, a frail truce between the Turkish army and Kurdish separatists was coming unraveled. (Immensely destructive military campaigns have since swept the region.) Refugees were flooding into Turkey from war-ruined Syria. And the tamed Tigris and Euphrates squeezed their way through endless pipes and concrete channels to distant Basra, the home of Sinbad the Sailor. Even now, however, not all is yet lost. Yazar’s images remind us, through their sensitive portraits of the gritty riverside communities still struggling to adapt, that time yet remains to save what remains of the region’s ecosystems and traditional lifeways. Yazar’s photographs are not mere lament. They are a call to action. Scroll down to see the images, or click on the photo below to launch a slideshow.

1898,2024-09-17 11:04:00,Yale Environment 360,https://e360.yale.edu/features/batwa-kahuzi-biega-national-park-drc,Fortress Conservation: Can a Congo Tribe Return to Its Forest?,Wildlife & Conservation,Public Health & Environment,"A landmark ruling from the African Union, the continent’s foremost intergovernmental body, has called into question who should run many of its 250-plus national parks, home to much of its unique wildlife. In late July, the union’s African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights ruled, after nine years of deliberation, that the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) should hand back parts of the giant Kahuzi-Biega National Park in the forested east of the country to its ancestral owners, the Batwa people. Such a restitution would right a terrible injustice, executed in the name of conservation. In the 1970s, after the park was established, the government expelled some 6,000 Batwa without consultation from the highland region of the park and revoked their customary land rights. The exiles were left landless and without compensation. To this day, many live in roadside squatter camps, often secretly entering the park to collect firewood, hunt for food, and practice rituals. “This is an incredibly important ruling, which will impact the thinking and discourse on conservation and land rights across Africa,” says Deborah Rogers, a former ecologist with the Nature Conservancy who has a long-standing interest in the park and is now president of the Initiative for Equality, a network of activist organizations. “It will set a legal precedent among member states of the African Union.” The ruling “recognizes an Indigenous Peoples’ crucial role in safeguarding the environment and biodiversity,” advocates say. The U.K.-based Forest Peoples Programme has estimated that Indigenous peoples and other forest dwellers have lost more than 400,000 square miles across Africa — an area the size of Texas and California combined — as a result of these “green grabs.” The Minority Rights Group, an international advocacy organization that helped bring the case to the commission, calls the ruling a “huge win” against “fortress conservation.” For the first time, the group notes, the commission’s ruling “recognizes an indigenous peoples’ crucial role in safeguarding the environment and biodiversity.” Joshua Castellino, the group’s co-executive director, says the ruling “hopefully establishes a new standard of African protection that can be extended to other instances across the continent and the world.” But Joseph Itongwa, the executive director of ANAPAC RDC, a Congolese alliance of local organizations advocating for Indigenous rights, urges caution, noting there is no guarantee the ruling will be implemented. “This is an important step for the promotion of our rights,” he says. “But it is not binding. We have not seen, or yet know, of any official reactions from the government.” Some observers question whether decades after being forced off their lands, the Batwa are prepared to manage the park for conservation and protect its critical species, including one of the world’s last populations of eastern lowland gorillas. Batwa celebrate the African Commission ruling in the town of Kalehe this month. Forest Peoples Programme. And some key players are biding their time. The New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), which has been helping to manage the Kahuzi-Biega National Park area since before its inception and has been effectively in charge since 2022, says it “takes note” of the ruling. But it declined to answer questions from Yale Environment 360 about whether it supports the ruling or will help to implement it. But a Batwa elder now based in Bukavu near the park, who answered on condition of anonymity, explained why the ruling was so important to the tribe. “Our traditional lands in the park are numerous, because each clan has its own hills. Among these hills, there are sacred sites where we communicated with the ancestors and communed with the forest, which we consider to be the nourishing mother. These lands our are identity. To deprive us of them is to exterminate us.” The African Commission’s ruling is legally significant. It finds that the DRC government has violated 11 articles on human rights in the African Charter, to which it is a signatory. These include the rights of the Batwa to life, property, natural resources, development, health, religion, and culture. And it calls on the government to adopt into law as soon as possible “an effective mechanism for the delimitation, demarcation and titling of the territory traditionally occupied by the Batwa and the various natural resources attached to it in accordance with their tradition,” and to annul all laws “prohibiting the presence of the Batwa on ancestral lands and the enjoyment of the fruits of these lands.” The forced eviction of Indigenous people has often been planned, helped, and funded by Western conservation groups. The African Union has endorsed the commission’s decision, but it is far from clear how the Congolese government will respond. According to an attorney based in Bukavu, who is part-Batwa and has been following the case closely, the government has all along attempted to thwart the commission’s investigation. “It has never responded to correspondence addressed to it by the Commission, nor appeared before it, even though it is a signatory member of the African Charter.” (Neither the commission nor the DRC government has responded to requests for comment.) The attorney, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, says the commission “does not have the power to enforce its recommendations,” but two other courts on human and peoples’ rights linked to the African Union do have such powers. “If the DRC government continues to show bad faith, we will ask them to issue binding decisions,” the attorney says. The forced eviction of Indigenous people, such as the Batwa, from their ancestral lands across Africa has been widespread for decades. Usually carried out in the name of conservation, it has in the past often been planned, helped, and funded by Western conservation groups such as the WCS and World Wildlife Fund (WWF). The Batwa of Central Africa have particularly suffered. Batwa villagers on the edge of Kahuzi-Biega National Park. Mathias Rittgerott / RdR Physical violence has been frequent. In 2020, the U.N. Development Programme concluded that WWF had for years funded park guards that it knew inflicted violence on Baka people in the region’s parks. The U.S. government subsequently withdrew funding for the organization’s work in the region. The exposure of such atrocities has come at the same time as evidence has accumulated globally that Indigenous Peoples, often denigrated as forest destroyers, are more usually forest guardians — more effective conservationists than the park managers who often replace them. The benefits of their custodianship should not be exaggerated. U.N. agencies and others claim that 80 percent of the world’s biodiversity is in Indigenous territories. A commentary in the journal Nature this month — signed by Indigenous people and rights activists as well as ecologists — contends there is no evidence to support this claim. But the authors say their questioning of the statistic should not “detract from the essential, and verifiably considerable, part that Indigenous Peoples play in the conservation of the planet’s biodiversity,” noting their “lands include more than one-third of the world’s intact forest landscapes.” “The Batwa are used as scapegoats when illicit activities are discovered in the park,” says a conservationist. So the ruling by the African Commission on the land rights of the Batwa in the Kahuzi-Biega National Park, an epitome of attempted fortress conservation, is being seen by many as a wider adjudication. Leaving aside its symbolic importance, the Kahuzi-Biega park is an important biodiversity hotspot. Named after the two extinct volcanoes at its heart, it sits within the world’s second largest rainforest, covering the Congo Basin and highlands around the Great Lakes of Central Africa. It covers 2,300 square miles and is home to 14 species of primates, including chimpanzees and one of the last groups of eastern lowland gorillas. UNESCO made it a World Heritage Site and calls it “one of the ecologically richest regions of Africa.” But almost since its designation in 1970 and the subsequent expulsion of its Batwa inhabitants, the park has been in trouble. Park guards have been unable to repel repeated incursions from non-Batwa people. These have included Hutu refugees from the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda, and militias hiding there during the two civil wars in eastern DRC later that decade. It was during this period that a rapid decline in gorillas and elephants occurred, resulting in UNESCO in 1997 putting the park on its list of endangered World Heritage Sites, where it remains today.

Alexis Huguet / AFP via Getty Images Many armed groups stayed on after the civil wars, setting up crude mining operations for coltan (used in cellphones and personal computers), cassiterite (tin ore), and gold. Park guards failed to evict them. Fergus O’Leary Simpson, a researcher at the University of Antwerp’s Institute of Development Policy, who regularly visits the area, reports local people say that some senior officials of the Congolese Institute for the Conservation of Nature (ICCN), the government agency that controls the park, are themselves involved in mining and that senior military figures provide weapons to armed groups. In 2005, the chairman of a Congolese mining company, Cosma Wilungula, was appointed director-general of the ICCN. After 16 years, he was removed from office in 2021 amid allegations of embezzlement. Two years later, the U.S. State Department barred him from entry to the United States on grounds of “significant corruption.” Through all this, says Rogers, “the Batwa are used as scapegoats when illicit activities are discovered in the park.” And when in 2018, after years of failed negotiations with the ICCN aimed at restoring some of their land rights, some 2,000 Batwa returned in family groups to their old villages, there was a fierce reaction from park guards and the military, including the shelling and burning of villages. A subsequent report for the Minority Rights Group concluded that at least 20 Batwa were killed and 15 women raped in attacks over three years. “While the Batwa have suffered a great injustice, they are no longer living as forest guardians,” says a researcher. An international outcry after the report’s publication triggered a change in management at the park. In 2022, WCS secured a public-private partnership agreement with the DRC government that gave it effective control of the park. WCS set up a management board that included Batwa representation and formally recognized “the legitimate claims of the Batwa to their remaining ancestral land inside the Park” and the need for “finding a durable land solution.” But there is little sign of that solution so far, critics say. “There is a vast discrepancy between what WCS puts out in public relations statements, and what WCS actually does,” says Rogers. Simpson says the main change since the agreement [WCS was substantially managing before, but with less authority] is that “park guards have largely ceased patrolling this region for at least two years.” Simpson resists the idea that restoring Batwa land rights offers a ready conservation solution. “While the Batwa have suffered a great injustice, they are no longer living as forest guardians.” He says that some Batwa chiefs within the park collude with the militias, taking money in return for letting them cut trees for firewood and charcoal to sell in nearby urban areas. The result, he says, is “thousands of hectares of deforestation,” visible in satellite images. A guard with the Congolese Institute for the Conservation of Nature burns the homes of Batwa in Kahuzi-Biega National Park in 2019. Kahuzi-Biega National Park Simpson accuses human rights lobbyists of having an “overly idealized image of the Batwa as ecologically noble savages.” Even so, he says the Batwa are minor players in a wider economy of ecological destruction. The problem, he says, is that the park is full of lootable resources and provides “ideal hideouts” for illegal activity. In such a lawless environment, he says, militarized conservation is “the only feasible form of enforcement.” But advocates for the Batwa push back strongly against that. They argue the Batwa are the primary victims of the lawlessness, which arises from a corrupt and militarized system of park management. They say the obvious solution — as concluded by the African Commission — is the restoration of land rights for the Batwa. But they will need help, agrees Rogers. “Does the [commission ruling] mean that the Batwa could step back into Kahuzi-Biega and take over as conservation managers tomorrow? Of course not,” she says. “They will need lots of expert research and consulting, just as do the current managers. They will also need help in dealing with the militias, mining operations, and refugees.” But, Rogers says, “I am completely convinced that their objectives and worldview give them a much better shot at protecting nature.” The Batwa have so far not been able to benefit from a system for establishing community management of forests. Ironically, Rogers points out, the DRC already has a system for establishing community management of forests. Since 2016, communities outside national parks have been allowed to take formal control of up to 120,000 acres of forest around their villages from the government. They are then allowed to exploit those forests according to an agreed management plan. These concessions have been widely applauded by both conservationists and land-rights NGOs. So far, 200 have been granted, covering more than 11 million acres, including 23 in South Kivu, the DRC province that contains most of the Kahuzi-Biega park’s highlands. But Batwa communities made homeless by exile from the park have so far not been able to benefit. “The concessions are the best and still probably the only available basis for the Batwa to obtain their rights,” says Joe Eisen, director of the Rainforest Foundation U.K., which runs a database on the community forests. Rogers agrees that forest concessions are a potentially valuable tool. “But this doesn’t absolve the government agencies, donors, and NGOs of their responsibility to implement the African Commission’s ruling,” she says. “In the long run, righting the wrongs done to the Batwa is the only way to obtain justice, restore their culture, and protect nature.”","The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights ruled that the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo should hand back parts of the giant Kahuzi-Biega National Park.

NOAA A half-century ago, scientists posited that whales might able to talk with each other across great distances, but for decades, no one had managed to catch two whales in the act. A new study offers the first compelling evidence that baleen whales can synchronize their dives despite being many miles apart. “The possibility of acoustically connected whales, which seem to be diving alone but are actually together, is mind-bending,” lead author Evgeny Podolskiy, of Hokkaido University, said in a statement . In 1971, scientists Roger Payne and Douglas Webb first suggested that baleen whales may travel in highly diffuse herds, communicating with other whales in their pack across long distances. And they showed that fin whales, a type of baleen whale, are able to issue calls that travel hundreds of miles through the ocean. In the intervening years, scientists have occasionally spotted whales appearing to communicate across some distance, but none could show the whales were speaking to each other. For the new study, scientists tracked 12 bowhead whales, a kind of baleen whale, who were wearing tags that broadcast their depth and location as they traversed the waters around Greenland. Analyzing the dive data, scientists discovered that two of the whales were syncing their dives for up to a week at a time whenever they drifted within around 60 miles of each other — the maximum range for whale calls in this part of the ocean. While the apparent syncing may be a coincidence, Podolskiy told Hakai , “Our current belief is that it’s related to communication somehow.” The findings , published in Physical Review Research , may the first first evidence for Payne and Webb’s theory. “This is very, very peculiar underwater behavior,” said Podolskiy. “It was very exciting.” ALSO ON YALE E360 Octopuses Are Highly Intelligent.

That water will freeze into ice crystals that eventually fall to the earth, melting into raindrops as they waft toward the ground.

The study was published in Environmental Research Letters. In light of the findings, the researchers call for incorporating the effect of pollen into climate models. As the planet warms and springs grow longer, pollen counts are edging upwards. More airborne pollen could lead to to more frequent and intense rainfall in the decades to come, said lead author Jan Kretzschmar, of the University of Leipzig in Germany.

2282,2024-09-12 11:39:00,Yale Environment 360,https://e360.yale.edu/features/ev-school-buses,"Slowly but Surely, U.S. School Buses Are Starting to Electrify",Public Health & Environment,Sustainability,"About 20 million students in the United States ride to school each day on the familiar yellow bus. The vast majority of the nation’s roughly 490,000 school buses — which comprise the nation’s largest public-transportation fleet — are powered by diesel engines. “We’re poisoning our kids on the way to school,” said Jessica Keithan, cofounder and director of the Texas Electric School Bus Project, of the exhaust that inevitably infiltrates bus interiors and children’s lungs. But that’s slowly beginning to change. Thanks to a slate of federal and state incentive programs, school districts all over the country are starting to swap out old diesel buses for new, zero-emissions electric-powered models. This transition is reaching districts of all sizes and demographics, from Martinsville Independent School District in East Texas — which last year became the first in the country to go fully electric with four new buses — to Oakland Unified School District in California — which last month became the first large urban district to fully electrify its fleet, with 74 buses. As the Environmental Protection Agency, through its $5 billion Clean School Bus program, and state initiatives continue to fund electric bus purchases, advocates are identifying challenges to wider adoption and grappling with how to surmount them. Replacing decades-old buses may lead to benefits in educational performance and school attendance rates, said one study. Five years ago, there were fewer than a thousand electric school buses operating nationwide, the majority of them in higher-income suburban districts. But since the EPA launched its Clean School Bus (CSB) program in 2022, authorized by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the number of electric buses on the road has climbed to nearly 5,000. And more than 7,000 additional buses are under contract, awaiting delivery, or have been awarded funding and will soon be ordered. From a health perspective, there’s urgency to replacing the nation’s diesel buses with cleaner alternatives. Health experts have long known that children are uniquely vulnerable to air pollution because their lungs, brains, and other major organs are still developing. They breathe faster and take in a higher volume of air relative to their body weight. Diesel exhaust is classified as a carcinogen by the World Health Organization and contains fine particles and nitrogen oxides, both of which are well-documented asthma triggers. Research shows that children in lower-income areas and communities of color are exposed to higher levels of outdoor air pollution — from major roadways, industries, and ports with diesel truck operations. They also suffer much higher rates of asthma and respiratory illness. And so it’s particularly important, say public health experts and school officials, to get polluting school buses off the streets. Children aboard an electric school bus in Chevy Chase, Maryland, last February. Tom Brenner / AP Photo. Meredith Pedde, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Michigan’s School of Public Health, led a study published earlier this year that found that replacing decades-old buses may lead to proportionately greater benefits in educational performance and attendance rates. She and her colleagues drew on data from an earlier EPA program that randomly allocated funding for cleaner diesel, gas, or propane school buses from 2012 through 2017. They found that districts that received funding for bus upgrades saw significant improvements in students’ attendance rates and in math and literacy test scores. “One of our hypotheses is that higher exposures could lead to missed days of school, and that’s associated with lower performance,” said Pedde. “But there’s also evidence that air pollution can directly impact the brain and impair cognitive performance.” Pedde and her colleagues found that those educational performance gains happened only in districts that replaced pre-1990 diesel buses (there are nearly 5,000 pre-1990 buses in the U.S. fleet, her paper estimated). Those that replaced newer diesels saw test-score changes comparable to scores in districts that were not selected for funding to receive cleaner buses. Her research suggests there are greater health benefits from getting the oldest diesel buses off the road than from replacing more recent models, which must meet more stringent emissions standards. Low-income and minority communities still have the highest shares of older, polluting diesel buses. The EPA’s CSB program stipulates that electric buses must be replacing diesel buses from 2010 or earlier. Many state programs have similar requirements. “In addition to socioeconomic factors, we need to make sure that programs are also targeting the oldest buses,” Pedde said. In Texas, there are at least five school districts still running buses made in the 1970s, according to Keithan. The CSB program is designed to give preference for new bus funding to the highest-need districts. According to a recent report from the World Resources Institute’s Electric School Bus Initiative, districts with higher shares of low-income households generally have more students riding polluting buses to school than do other districts. The good news is that 74 percent of the grants or rebates awarded to date are in low-income, rural, or tribal school districts, according to the EPA. “The greatest burden of air quality and health impacts is on students of color, students with disabilities, low-income students,” said Sue Gander, director of WRI’s initiative. “They are the ones who need to be part of this transition first.” “The [EPA] policy has led to this desired outcome,” Gander said. “That’s really encouraging.” But she and other advocates readily acknowledge there’s a long way to go, because low-income and minority communities still have the highest shares of older, polluting diesel buses. And across the nation, only 2.5 percent of all school buses are electric.  There are many reasons for this gap but the biggest is, not surprisingly, money. While a new diesel school bus costs between $125,000 and $150,000, a new electric bus costs between $300,000 and $400,000. And then there are the ancillary costs, including the installation of chargers (which can cost up to $140,000), upgrading transformers and lines to bring power to them, and training employees to manage these new systems. Even the process of navigating incentive applications can impose prohibitive costs on some school systems. “I don’t have grant writers,” said Kim Raney, executive director of transportation for the Oakland Unified School District. Instead, Raney worked with Zum, a transportation service provider that financed and manages the new fleet, to obtain various EPA and state incentives to make the math work and with the California utility PG&E to install the charging equipment. While school administrators may want to improve air quality on buses and on school grounds, they are operating under tight fiscal constraints, especially in rural districts, which tend to have not just older buses but also longer routes, meaning students can be exposed to more pollution per mile. Rural districts usually have smaller budgets, making it difficult to hire technical consultants to help apply for grants or rebates, train drivers, and coordinate with utilities to run power to the chargers in their bus yards. Thousands of electric school buses with their batteries plugged into the grid could effectively function like a power plant. And yet some rural districts have made the leap, like one in southern Illinois’ Hardin County, which now operates 12 electric buses in partnership with Highland Fleets, a “electrification-as-a-service” company that helps reduce the cost of going electric for school districts. Highland purchases the buses, oversees permitting and installation of equipment, trains maintenance staff, maintains the fleet, and pays for the electricity. The company charges school districts a fixed annual fee. Protecting students’ health is front of mind for many school officials interested in making the transition to electric buses, Gander said. “There are also clear greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits to electric buses, and a lot of areas with climate plans are motivated by those goals.” But there are other benefits, too. Electric buses are much cheaper to operate than diesels: According to a government-funded study published by the National Renewable Energy Lab, they reduce maintenance costs by 44.1 cents per mile compared to their diesel counterparts. Keithan has found that the prospect of saving money is the most persuasive selling point for school administrators with tight budgets, while the health benefits are, she says, icing on the cake.

Gabby Jones / Bloomberg via Getty Images Another prospective financial benefit for districts is the bus’s capability of feeding power back to the grid, especially during times of peak demand. Thousands of electric school buses with their batteries plugged into the grid could effectively function like a power plant, which can help utilities avoid the expense and pollution of ramping up “peaker” plants to meet spikes in electricity usage. Pilot programs in Colorado and Massachusetts are currently seeking to demonstrate how electric school buses can provide these “vehicle-to-grid” charging services — and make money doing so. Getting more utilities on board to quickly install chargers and deliver power to them is essential, said Matt Stanberry, vice president of Highland Fleets. So is encouraging utilities and state public utility commissions to create special rates and programs to compensate school districts for sending power into the grid when their buses are sitting in the yard, which is about 70 percent of the time during the school year and most of the summer, when many states see peaks in power demand The Clean School Bus program, which ends in 2026, has awarded nearly $3 billion of its $5 billion total. The EPA is planning to announce a fourth round of funding this fall, offering up to $932 million. But incentives alone can’t push all dirty diesel buses off roads, said Keithan. “This market has to be able to support itself.” Of course, like other clean energy technologies, electric buses are expected to become more affordable with wider deployment. EPA officials say that they anticipate “that bus prices will decline as production scales, EV battery costs fall, and more electric buses are deployed.” A month after going fully electric, Oakland’s school bus fleet is working well, the district’s transportation director says. For districts that struggle to afford new electric buses and have more recent diesel models in their fleet, there are other, less-discussed options: repowering them . The process involves swapping out diesel engines for electric drivetrains, at a cost of between $110,000 and $180,000. It would also prevent older diesels from being sold to poorer districts or being shipped abroad, where they would continue to pollute other children’s lungs. “It’s a faster way to serve underserved districts, to repower assets they already own,” said Keithan. “It can be done more quickly, with regional labor, at a fraction of the cost.” Despite those advantages, repowers are not that common because districts must ensure their buses comply with federal, state, and city safety regulations, and mechanics willing to do the work may be hard to find. What’s more, repowers aren’t eligible for the EPA’s CSB funding. Keithan said policymakers should think more broadly and creatively about how to reduce the logistical and financial barriers to accessing this new technology. Making it easier to do repowers and requiring utilities to set aside money for programs that equip schools for charging buses, she said, are two key ways they can accelerate the transition for everyone. In the meantime, going fully electric may be a “leap of faith,” said Raney, of the Oakland Unified School District, but one well worth taking. A month into the school year, her district’s fleet of new electric buses are working well. And just last week the district performed the first test of its vehicle-to-grid system, with buses sending power back to PG&E for three hours. “It went off without a hitch,” she said. Correction, September 12, 2024: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that a Hardin County, Illinois, school district is operating 18 electric buses. It is operating 12, as the article now states.","About 20 million students in the United States ride to school each day on the familiar yellow bus. The vast majority of the nation’s roughly 490,000 school buses are powered by diesel engines. Thanks to a slate of federal and state incentive programs, school districts are starting to swap out old diesel buses for new, zero-emissions electric-powered models. This transition is reaching districts of all sizes and demographics, from Martinsville Independent School District in East Texas to Oakland Unified School District, California.",http://res.cloudinary.com/drwsupfyj/image/upload/v1728706240/state-of-the-earth/news_photographs/slowlybutsurelyusschoolbusesarestartingtoelectrify.jpg

But on a small operation called Salvatierra, 40 minutes south of Minneapolis, Reginaldo Haslett-Marroquin is trying something different. When he bought the land in 2020, this 18-acre patch had been devoted for decades to the region’s most prevalent crops. The soil was so depleted, Haslett-Marroquin says, he thought of it as a “corn and soybean desert.” Soon after, he applied 13 tons of compost, sowed a mix of prairie grasses and rye, and planted 8,200 hazelnut saplings. While he won’t reap a nut harvest until 2025, the farmer and Guatemalan immigrant doesn’t have to wait to make money from the land. He also runs flocks of chickens in narrow grassy paddocks between the rows of the fledging trees, where they hunt for insects and also munch on feed made from organic corn and soybeans, which they transform into manure that fertilizes the trees and forage. Salvatierra is the latest addition to Tree-Range Farms, a cooperative network of 19 poultry farms cofounded in 2022 by Haslett-Marroquin. Chickens evolved from birds known as junglefowl in the forests of South Asia, he notes, and the co-op’s goal is to conjure that jungle-like habitat. Chickens crave shade and fear open spaces; trees shelter them from weather and hide them from predators. In 2021, Haslett-Marroquin’s nonprofit, Regenerative Agriculture Alliance, purchased a poultry slaughterhouse just south of the Minnesota border in Stacyville, Iowa, where farms in the Tree-Range network process their birds. You can find the meat in natural-food stores from the Twin Cities area to northern Iowa. The USDA has launched a $60-million effort to expand agroforestry production and markets in the central and eastern U.S. By combining food-bearing trees and shrubs with poultry production, Haslett-Marroquin and his peers are practicing what is known as agroforestry — an ancient practice that intertwines annual and perennial agriculture. Other forms include alley cropping, in which annual crops including grains, legumes, and vegetables grow between rows of food-bearing trees, and silvopasture, which features cattle munching grass between the rows. Agroforestry was largely abandoned in the United States after the nation’s westward expansion in the 19 th century. In the 2022 Agricultural Census, just 1.7 percent of U.S. farmers reported integrating trees into crop and livestock operations. But it’s widely practiced across the globe, particularly in Southeast Asia and Central and South America. According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, 43 percent of all agricultural land globally includes agroforestry features. Bringing trees to the region now known as the Corn Belt, known for its industrial-scale agriculture and largely devoid of perennial crops, might seem like the height of folly. On closer inspection, however, agroforestry systems like Haslett-Marroquin’s might be a crucial strategy for both preserving and revitalizing one of the globe’s most important farming regions. And while the corn-soybean duopoly that holds sway in the U.S. heartland produces mainly feed for livestock and ethanol, agroforestry can deliver a broader variety of nutrient-dense foods, like nuts and fruit, even as it diversifies farmer income away from the volatile global livestock-feed market. In recognition of this potential, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), in late 2022, launched a $60 million grant program to help farmers adopt such practices. Reginaldo Haslett-Marroquin at his first farm, Finca Marisol, in Northfield, Minnesota. Leia Marasovich / Farmer’s Footprint For decades, Midwestern farmers have devoted tens of millions of acres to just two crops, leaving the ground largely unprotected from wind and rain between harvest and planting. As a result, the loamy trove of topsoil that settlers found there has been pillaged. Using satellite imagery, a team of University of Massachusetts researchers has calculated that a third of the land in the present-day Corn Belt has completely lost its layer of carbon-rich soil. And what’s left is washing away at least 25 times faster than it naturally replenishes. As prime topsoil vanishes, farmers become more dependent on fertilizers derived from fossil fuel. Not surprisingly, given those applications, the Corn Belt is also in the midst of a burgeoning water-pollution crisis, as agrichemicals and manure from crowded livestock confinements leach away from farm fields and into streams and aquifers. In other words, our breadbasket is a basket case. As University of Washington geomorphologist David Montgomery noted in his magisterial 2007 book Dirt: The Erosion of Civilizations , “With just a couple feet of soil standing between prosperity and desolation, civilizations that plow through their soil vanish.” Trees actually have a much longer and more robust history in the Midwestern landscape than do annual crops. Breaking up the corn and soybean rotation with trees — and freeing some farm animals from vast indoor facilities to roam between rows, where their manure can be taken up by crops — could go a long way to addressing these crises, experts say. Trees actually have a much longer and more robust history in the Midwestern landscape than do annual crops. Think of the Midwestern countryside before U.S. settlers arrived, and you might picture lush grasses and flowers swaying in the wind. That vision is largely accurate, but it’s incomplete. Amid the tall-grass prairies and wetlands, oak trees once dotted landscapes from the shores of Lake Michigan through swathes of present-day Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Missouri, clear down to the Mexican border. These trees didn’t clump together in dense forests with closed canopies but rather in what ecologists call savannas — patches of grassland interspersed with oaks. Within these oak savannas, which were interlaced with prairies, tree crowns covered between 10 percent and 30 percent of the ground. They were essentially a transition between the tight deciduous forests of the East and the fully open grasslands further west. And in the region where Haslett-Marroquin farms — part of the so-called Driftless Area, which was never glaciated — trees proliferated even more intensely. In pre-settlement times, according to a 2014 analysis coauthored by Iowa State University ecologist Lisa Schulte Moore, closed-canopy forests of oaks, sugar maples, and other species covered 15.3 percent of the area, and woodlands (low-density forests) took up another 8.6 percent. Prairies — the ecosystem we readily imagine — composed just 6.9 percent. Oak savannas made up the rest. Corn grows between rows of walnut trees at the Missouri Agricultural Experiment Station. Shibu Jose / University of Missouri In the Driftless and in the rest of the Midwest, Native Americans played an active role in managing savannas, prairies, and forests, where they harvested nutrient-dense acorns for food and other uses. Everything began to change in the mid-19 th century, when settlers evicted or killed most of the original inhabitants, drained wetlands, razed trees for lumber, and ripped into the land with plows. In place of staggering biodiversity, an agricultural empire of row crops arose, tended with the tools of modern engineering and industry: genetically modified seeds, insect- and weed-killing chemicals, synthetic and mined fertilizers, and massive tractors and combines. Oak savannas, meanwhile, have been vanishing from the landscape. Today, they occupy a mere 0.02 percent of their historic Midwestern range. For most of the past century, any push to return trees to the Corn Belt centered on ecosystem services, not food production. Planting trees along streams and rivers — creating what’s known as riparian buffers — helps filter agrichemical runoff and improve water quality. Then there are “wind breaks,” stands of trees strategically placed to shelter crops from wind. But these practices remain rare, in part because they are marginalized by federal farm policies that reward maximizing the production of corn and soybeans, with subsidized crop insurance and price supports, and disincentivize planting alternative crops. Trees could play a much bigger role and, once established, could more than pay their way by delivering cash crops. A 2018 paper by University of Illinois researchers found that black walnut trees placed in rows between fields of corn and soybeans (alley cropping) would deliver more profits to landowners than field-crop-only farming on nearly a quarter of the Corn Belt’s land. An acre of land under agroforestry can sequester five metric tons of CO2 annually, versus one ton for an acre of corn or soybeans. Haslett-Marroquin and his fellow poultry farmers aren’t the only ones hoping to reimagine agriculture in the Corn Belt by reinstating the role of trees. The Savanna Institute, founded in 2013 by a group of farmers and academic researchers at a gathering in Illinois, promotes agroforestry in the region. Its funders include the U.S. Department of Agriculture and other government agencies, environmental foundations, and business interests including Patagonia and the family behind Clif Bar. In addition to operating demonstration farms in Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan, run in partnership with landowners, the Institute trains and places apprentices on farms that mix trees with crops or livestock. At the 250-acre Hawkeye Buffalo & Cattle Ranch in northeast Iowa, for example, the McFarland family sells grass-fed beef and bison meat from animals raised on restored oak savanna. The other “apprenticeship” farms are smaller operations. Fred Iutzi, the institute’s director of agroforestry innovation, says an arboreal revival throughout the region would make it more resilient to climate change. Tree canopies buffer soil from the impact of heavy rain, and their roots plunge deep beneath the soil surface and fan out laterally, further holding soil in place. They suck up nutrients all year long, keeping excess fertilizer and manure from leaching away and polluting water. Trees shield crops and soil from the wind. And they both build carbon in the soil as their leaves drop and decompose and store it in their roots, trunks, and branches. Altogether, Iutzi says, an acre of land under agroforestry can sequester five metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, versus about one ton for an acre of corn or soybeans under optimal conditions, which include reducing tillage and planting off-season cover crops. Cattle graze among trees in Marshall, Texas. USDA-NRCS While practices like alley cropping and silvopasture are eligible for support from USDA conservation programs, they haven’t been widely adopted. A recent study co-authored by Trent Ford, the Illinois state climatologist, found that between 2017 and 2023, the USDA’s Environmental Quality Incentives Program doled out just $900,000 to support agroforestry practices in the Corn Belt, a sliver of its overall budget. But more money is on the way. In 2022, as part of its $3.1 billion Partnership for Climate Smart Commodities program, the USDA announced a $60-million five-year effort to expand agroforestry production and markets in the central and eastern regions of the United States, plus Hawaii. Managed by The Nature Conversancy in partnership with the Savanna Institute and other groups, the project’s goal is 30,000 new acres of agroforestry by 2026, says TNC’s Audrey Epp Schmidt, who leads the project. So far, 35 projects have been selected for funding, eight in the Corn Belt. For now, an agroforestry renaissance remains at a nascent phase, Epp Schmidt says, “but there’s a ton of momentum, there’s a historic amount of resources and opportunities for folks to get into it.” What the movement needs, she says, is a farmer-to-farmer network: “That’s really when this is going to take off — when farmers see the success of their neighbor’s [agroforestry] operations.” It’s impossible to say what type of event would force farmers to drastically change course in the Corn Belt. Even so, the Corn Belt will be a tough nut to crack, says Silvia Secchi, a natural resource economist at the University of Iowa. Such expenditures, while important, will struggle to overcome the formidable inertia of corn and soybeans. The proximate reason is the subsidies that keep the region’s farmers afloat even as their soil washes away. But ultimately, she says, farmers in the region “strive to be as simple as possible and as mechanized as possible” — a mindset that favors focusing on two cash crops instead of a more complex, labor-intensive approach, like agroforestry. Yet Iutzi remains hopeful. In the 1920s, he says, the idea of a federal farm policy centered on soil conservation seemed beyond the realm of possibility. Then came the Dust Bowl, a severe soil-erosion crisis that triggered New Deal legislation that, for a time, tempered overproduction of farm commodities and held soil in place. It’s impossible to say precisely what type of event would force policymakers and farmers to drastically change course in the Corn Belt. But as the region’s vast corn and soybean operations continue hemorrhaging soil and fouling water and climate change proceeds apace, they may find themselves looking for new directions sooner than later. Iutzi thinks projects like Tree Range Farms could show the way forward. “History is just absolutely peppered with this pattern of big disruptions of one kind or another being the catalyst for big change,” he says. “And it’s ideas that are really well honed, when the time comes, that really surge.”","Reginaldo Haslett-Marroquin and his peers are practicing what is known as agroforestry.

Defenders “continue to face criminalization, legal harassment, and threats of violence and murder,” the report said, noting that Peru ranks among the most dangerous countries in the world for environmental activists. The numbers from Peru reflect a broader global trend, according to a new report from Global Witness, which finds that killings of environmental defenders have been increasing for more than a decade worldwide. “Murder continues to be a common strategy for silencing defenders and is unquestionably the most brutal,” authors said. The report found that Latin America is far and away the most deadly region in the world, accounting for 166 of the 196 defenders killed last year. Included in that tally were four slain defenders in Peru. Peru is also seeing violence take the lives of land intruders. Earlier this month, the Mashco Piro people, the world’s largest uncontacted tribe , killed two loggers encroaching on their lands. “This is a tragedy that was entirely avoidable,” said Caroline Pearce of Survival International.

1986,2024-09-05 12:09:00,Yale Environment 360,https://e360.yale.edu/features/joshua-trees-climate-change,"With Hotter, Drier Weather, California’s Joshua Trees Are in Trouble",Wildlife & Conservation,Sustainability,"In 2020, the Dome Fire swept through Southern California’s Mojave National Preserve, blackening nearly 70 square miles of highly biodiverse desert. The conflagration killed 1.3 million Joshua trees, including most of those on Cima Dome, one of the largest and densest Joshua tree woodlands in the world. Then in 2023, the York Fire swept through and burned a large section of adjacent Joshua tree forest, killing another million or so trees. The destruction on Cima Dome — which is higher in elevation and cooler than the surrounding desert — came as an especially severe blow to the National Park Service and conservationists who had considered it a stronghold for the eastern Joshua tree and a key to the species’ future. Experts were planning to make Cima Dome a refuge by clearing out invasive grasses and monitoring the woodland’s health, said Andrew Kaiser, a botanist who worked at the Mojave National Preserve during the fires and now works for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, developing its Western Joshua Tree Conservation Plan. “The perimeter of the 2020 Dome fire was essentially the exact outline of the model climate refugia. It almost completely overlapped it.” Studies found that if warming temperatures aren’t mitigated, nearly 100 percent of the trees could be lost in the coming decades. The number of wildfires that kill and damage Joshua trees has increased sharply in recent years “in significant part due to changes in the desert ecosystem,” said Brendan Cummings, the conservation director of the Center for Biological Diversity, who lives in the town of Joshua Tree and is a leader in the fight to legally protect the trees. “Thirty years ago, a typical fire in a Joshua tree woodland would burn less than an acre. Lightning would hit a tree and it would fall. Rarely would it burn beyond an acre.” Now, he said, larger fires are prevalent. Such blazes are one of the major threats to Joshua trees: Hotter and drier weather, which kills seedlings and reduces recruitment of new trees, is another important factor. Studies from 2019 and 2011 found that if warming temperatures aren’t mitigated, nearly 100 percent of the trees across their range, which extends across parts of the southwestern United States, could be lost in the coming decades. That’s if development, especially of utility-scale solar farms, doesn’t wipe them out first. Joshua trees are a species of yucca: With their shaggy bark and their balls of jagged leaves at the ends of crooked branches, they look like something out of a Dr. Seuss book. The Spanish called them izote de desierto , the desert dagger, and the local Cahuilla tribe calls them humwichawa. Mormon settlers are said to have named the tree after the prophet Joshua, who kept his hands raised and spread to guide the Israelites. Mature trees range from 75 years old to more than 300, and seedlings take about 30 years to reach maturity. Yale Environment 360 The Joshua tree has two distinct subspecies: the western Joshua tree, which occurs mostly in California — including Joshua Tree National Park, a stronghold — and the eastern species, which is found in much of eastern California, southern Nevada, western Arizona, and in a small corner of Utah. Each depends on a single species of moth for pollination — a moth that doesn’t pollinate the other species. They are also critical to desert biodiversity. “They are keystone species, which means they create more habitat for other species and increase the biodiversity of the overall desert,” said Cameron Barrows, a retired University of California, Riverside, research ecologist who studies Joshua trees. “Everything from red-tailed hawks to great horned owls to Scott’s orioles and cactus wrens — their density and abundance is tied to the availability of nesting sites, and Joshua trees are really the only nesting sites in much of the Mojave Desert.” The desert night lizard uses its fallen branches for shelter; the threatened desert tortoise consumes Joshua tree flowers; and the blacktail jack rabbit and desert wood rat depend on the water inside their trunk tissues. Climate change is a major contributor to shifts in the Mojave’s fire regime. The vast increase in acres burned is in part due to hotter temperatures, which increase the growth rate of invasive grasses. The desert’s average temperature has gone up as much as 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees C) in the last hundred years, and rainfall has declined by up to 20 percent in some areas. Precipitation in the Mojave, the most arid place in North America, varies widely but averages 5 inches a year. Joshua trees are highly adapted to the searing heat of the Mojave, flourishing in temperatures of more than 120 degrees F (49 degrees C). But they need moisture, too, and climate change has brought drought. The York Fire burned roughly a million Joshua trees in Mojave National Preserve in August 2023. L.E. Baskow / Las Vegas Review-Journal / Tribune News Service via Getty Images Climate change is expected to continue to drive extreme swings in California’s weather in the coming years. And while a couple of recent wet winters have helped new Joshua seedlings to sprout, their survival isn’t assured: Joshua trees need a dependable supply of moisture to make it through their early years. “The temperature is important, but rainfall is really important,” said Barrows. “If you couple higher temperatures and drier conditions, you are screwed.” At the same time, wet years also help plant species that threaten the Joshua tree. “Over the last few decades, the invasive grasses originally brought here by cattle ranching and other sources have taken over the Mojave, [changing] the fire regime,” said Cummings. Grasses such as red brome and Mediterranean split grass are highly flammable, and in wet years they grow in profusion and create more intense and far more widespread fires. There is also concern that the invasion of exotic species, in combination with climate change and the deposition of atmospheric nitrogen — which wafts in from the smoggy Los Angeles basin and stimulates the growth of flammable grasses — will keep the post-fire Joshua woodlands from reestablishing themselves. Instead, those areas could convert to a non-native grassland with low biodiversity. Ironically, one of the biggest threats to trees are large-scale solar arrays that are being built to help wean California off fossil fuels. The western Joshua tree has been proposed for threatened status under the California Endangered Species Act and has been regulated, since 2023, by the state’s Western Joshua Tree Conservation Act, which forbids cutting trees from either private or public land without authorization from the state. The federal government, under both the Trump and Biden administrations, rejected federal endangered species protection for both subspecies, most recently in 2023. One reason for the lack of protection is that there is currently no shortage of Joshua trees — the threat is based on projections of future loss. The population of eastern Joshua trees is estimated to be several million, and the western population contains as many as 10 million trees. Nonetheless, Cummings argues that they are both deserving of protection because the forecasts of the future look bleak. “We know they are on an extinction trajectory, given the threat of climate change,” he said. “If climate change is frozen at current levels, we [still] lose half their range.” Temperatures, of course, are not expected to remain steady. Another potential threat to the western species is development in the Mojave Desert, where half of the trees occur on private land. (The vast majority of eastern Joshua trees grow on public land.) Ironically, one of the biggest threats to trees are large-scale solar arrays that are being built to help wean the state off fossil fuels. The 530-megawatt Aratina solar-plus-storage project, to be built on private land near Boron, California, would kill nearly 4,000 Joshua trees and reduce habitat for desert tortoises and other species. The desert tortoise, red-tailed hawk, and black-tailed jackrabbit all depend on Joshua trees. Daniel Elsbrock / NPS; Preston Jordan Jr. / NPS; Brad Sutton / NPS Solar developers oppose listing the tree as threatened. The California desert, along with the North African desert, has the highest solar radiance in the world, they argue, which makes it prime for generating electricity. “Our grid capacity needs to be expanded by numbers that are almost unimaginable,” Shannon Eddy, executive director of the Large-Scale Solar Association, told Vice News . “We’re just at the very leading edge of figuring this out. So to take huge swaths of the desert and set them off limits to solar development now, before we really know where they need to go, isn’t appropriate.” The Western Joshua Tree Conservation Act, which grandfathered in some solar projects, came about when the California Department of Fish and Wildlife deadlocked on whether to list the subspecies as threatened. A political compromise, the act passed because it offered more management flexibility than listing the tree. The act requires the Department of Fish and Wildlife to create — with other governmental agencies, California Native American tribes, and the public — a draft conservation plan for the species by December 31, 2024, and it requires companies to buy permits to cut down or relocate Joshua trees. Fees for permits will be used to create a conservation fund. The plan aims to protect not only the tree, but the larger Mojave Desert ecosystem — including trees, the desert tortoise, burrowing owls, rare plants, yucca moths, and other species — from the crush of development. “It’s by no means perfect,” said Cummings. “But it will bring things into a rational, orderly, and lawful space. High desert communities have really done a horrendous job of protecting the desert landscape from development.” Drew Kaiser, a botanist with the National Park Service, inspects invasive red brome grass in Mojave National Preserve. Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images One key part of the emerging conservation strategy, which is guided in part by a recent paper published in the journal Biological Conservation , is to protect the trees in refugia, designated areas where the Joshua tree forest is healthy and that might be cooler and less susceptible to drought as temperatures increase. In Joshua Tree National Park, managers are clearing grasses in refugia, for example, to remove fuel and create fire breaks between trees. Researchers are also mapping the trees’ genomes to predict which populations are most resilient to heat and drought so their preservation can be prioritized or their seeds used for replanting. Assisted migration — physically moving adult trees to Northern California and Oregon — has been considered. But “you can’t just move the Joshua tree,” Kaiser, from California’s Department of Fish and Wildlife, said. “You’ve got to move the nurse plants [which help seedlings get established]. You’ve got to move the yucca moth pollinator. You’ve got to monitor. All of the research we’ve seen so far suggests it’s not a viable option at this moment in time. But we’re not ruling it out.” In spite of all these threats, there are glimmers of hope. Increased use of electric vehicles in Southern California, for example, could reduce levels of the atmospheric nitrogen that fuels the growth of flammable grasses. And there is widespread commitment by concerned partners. “In areas that are well managed, like a national park, I am optimistic,” said Barrows, of UC Riverside. “Interestingly, there are some areas where trees are actually invading up into the pine forest and doing really well because it is higher, cooler, and wetter. So Joshua trees as a species are not going to go extinct, but areas of the Mojave Desert will become more ecologically depauperate if they lose the Joshua tree — unless we can reverse the climate change issue.”","In 2020, the Dome Fire killed 1.3 million Joshua trees, including most of those on Cima Dome. In 2023, the York Fire swept through and burned a large section of adjacent Joshua tree forest, killing another million or so trees. Studies found that if warming temperatures aren’t mitigated, nearly 100 percent of the trees could be lost in the coming decades. The number of wildfires that kill and damage Joshua trees has increased sharply in recent years “in significant part due to changes in the desert ecosystem,” said Brendan Cummings, the Center for Biological Diversity.",http://res.cloudinary.com/drwsupfyj/image/upload/v1728713133/state-of-the-earth/news_photographs/withhotterdrierweathercaliforniasjoshuatreesareintrouble.jpg

Targeted grazing is a tradition that goes back centuries, and Aliaga — whose earnings support his wife and three children in Peru — learned at a young age how to care for animals from his parents and grandparents. “This was passed down through generations,” he says. Unlike thinning with machinery, Aliaga’s goats don’t spill oil, spark fires, or disturb the soil. “This is more natural,” he says, “and at the same time they are fertilizing the land.” The goats are particularly keen to eat the leaves of poison oak and French broom, which are difficult to remove by hand.

A chunk of Antarctic ice as big as Florida and two thirds of a mile thick, the Thwaites Glacier disgorges into the ocean in a remote region of West Antarctica. Glaciologists say it may be on the verge of total collapse, which could swamp huge areas of low-lying coastal land around the world within a few decades. Now, ambitious plans to save it are set to become an early test of whether the world is prepared to enact massive geoengineering efforts to ward off the worst effects of climate change. Recent monitoring by uncrewed submarines and satellites, along with ice-sheet modeling, suggest that the Thwaites Glacier and its adjacent smaller twin, the Pine Island Glacier, may already be in a death spiral — eaten up by the intensifying speed and warmth of the powerful Antarctic Circumpolar Current. If they are past a point of no return, say researchers involved in the studies, then only massive human intervention can save them. Nothing is certain. A new modeling study published last week said the risk of unstoppable retreat of the glacier may be overblown. But there is no time to waste, argues the glaciologist orchestrating the call for action, John Moore of Lapland University, in northern Finland. Within two years, he and colleagues in Europe hope to be working in a Norwegian fjord, testing prototypes for a giant submarine curtain, up to 50 miles across, that could seal off the two glaciers from the remorseless Antarctic current. Glaciologists have discussed scary prognoses for the rapid collapse of giant Antarctic glaciers for almost half a century. Meanwhile, some of his collaborators, fearing the logistical complications of such a task, are pondering an even more mind-bending idea. They want to substitute the physical curtain with a giant “bubble curtain,” created by a constant injection of bubbles of air or cold surface water. Opponents of the plans, including many glaciologists, say such outlandish proposals are a dangerous diversion from the real task of mitigating climate change by curbing carbon emissions. But advocates say the two glaciers can’t wait. “We can’t mitigate our way out of this,” says Moore. “We need other tools.” Glaciologists have discussed scary prognoses for the rapid collapse of giant Antarctic glaciers for almost half a century. Glaciers in West Antarctica are particularly vulnerable because they are not sitting on solid land; they are surrounded by ocean and pinned precariously to the peaks of submarine mountains, between which the circumpolar current swirls. Back in 1978, glaciologist John Mercer, of Ohio State University, warned of a “major disaster – a rapid five-meter rise in sea level, caused by deglaciation of West Antarctica” — should atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide continue to rise. Three years later, glaciologist Terry Hughes, of the University of Maine, identified a “weak underbelly” to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, where the Thwaites and Pine Island glaciers drain into the Amundsen Sea, an arm of the Southern Ocean. European Space Agency / Adapted by Yale Environment 360 These glaciers are two of the ice continent’s five largest and are the gateway to the ocean for nearly half of the ice sheet. Hughes warned that the glaciers could easily lose their grip on the submarine mountains as warmer water melts ice directly beneath them, leading to their disintegration within a few decades. Their meltwater would raise sea levels globally by as much as 7 feet. That would rise to more than 12 feet if, as the pair suspected, the glaciers’ demise dragged down the rest of the ice sheet with it. These fears remained a theoretical concern until 20 years ago, when NASA glaciologist Eric Rignot warned that the seaward flow of these two giant glaciers was accelerating rapidly. It also became clear that the waters lapping at their submerged edges were warming as a result of climate change, and that this melting effect was much greater than the effect of warming air. Ted Scambos of the University of Colorado, who is a coordinator of the joint U.S.-UK International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, says that now “the [Thwaites] glacier is flowing at over a mile per year,” nearly double the speed in the 1990s. The warm ocean current is “eroding the base of the ice, erasing it as an ice cube would disappear bobbing in a glass of water.” Scambos believes the accelerated flow is bound to continue. “By flowing faster, the glacier pulls down the ice behind it.” While shallower ice grinds on the bedrock and gets held back, he explains, thicker ice is less constrained and so flows faster, “leading to more retreat.” “Some say it is too late to prevent [Thwaites’] collapse,” says a glaciologist. “Others say we could have 200 years.” This concern has only heightened with the recent publication of satellite radar images revealing that the height of the Thwaites Glacier rises and falls with the tides. Rignot, now at the University of California, Irvine, says this finding shows that the warm current is not just lapping at the front of the glacier but is penetrating several miles beneath the grounded ice, further loosening its contact with solid rock. Modelers of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet caution against assuming the worst. Much remains unknown. Last week, Mathieu Morlighem of Dartmouth College, along with British colleagues, reported that one potential cause of collapse of the Thwaites Glacier — runaway instability of the ice cliff at the front of the glacier — was less likely than some propose, at least in the short term. But he said there was a “pressing need” for further research into these potentially devastating processes. There is, Moore agrees, no consensus among glaciologists about whether the Thwaites Glacier is past a point of no return unless there is drastic intervention. “Some say it is too late to prevent its collapse; others say we could have 200 years. But it certainly could be beyond its tipping point, and we have to be prepared.” Time-lapse satellite imagery of ice breaking off the Pine Island Glacier from 2015 to 2020.  Last month, Moore and an international team of researchers published a “research vision” for “glacial climate intervention.” It followed workshops held last year at Stanford and the University of Chicago with fellow glaciologists, and it warned that if tipping points at the two glaciers have or will soon be crossed, then whatever happens to greenhouse gas emissions in the future “will have little effect on preserving the ice sheet.” Ice-sheet modeling last year by Kaitlin Naughten of the British Antarctic Survey concurred. “The opportunity to preserve the West Antarctic Ice Sheet in its present-day state has probably passed,” she concluded, “and policymakers should be prepared for several metres of sea level rise over the coming centuries.” So what can be done? Last month’s “vision” did not directly advocate for geoengineering interventions but called for research into which of them may be viable. It highlighted a proposal for a series of giant overlapping plastic or fiber curtains tethered to concrete foundations. To hold the warm current at bay, the curtain would stretch for 50 miles across the entrance to the Amundsen Sea and extend upwards for much of the 2,000 feet from the sea floor to the surface. Some experts are confident that giant undersea curtains can be built to withstand the forces they will face in the ocean. Moore wants to get started on testing the idea, and he and his collaborators are seeking research funding. The first experiments in a large lab tank are expected to begin within a few weeks at Cambridge University’s Centre for Climate Repair, whose mission is to advance “climate repair projects that can be rolled out at scale within the next 5-10 years.” Real-world experiments could follow quickly, says Moore. “Within two years, we could be working at a fjord in northern Norway, testing different designs in a marine setting.” He has identified a target fjord but won’t say where. “If that goes well, we would want to scale up to a curtain as much as a kilometer across.” He envisions this being tested among the glaciers of Svalbard, the Norwegian Arctic archipelago that has become an international center for polar research. “In 10-15 years, we should have something to deploy in Antarctica,” he says. Moore is confident that such giant curtains can be built to withstand the forces they will face in the ocean. “And installation seems feasible with existing technology,” he says. Even so, deployment and maintenance would be a huge undertaking in an environmentally hostile region some 1,500 miles from the nearest ice-free land in South America. And potential impacts on local marine ecosystems from both installation and operation remain essentially unknown, he says. So a diminished version might be tried at the start, says Michael Wolovick of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven, Germany. Much could be accomplished with a curtain just three miles wide stretching across a “choke point” in front of the most vulnerable part of the Thwaites Glacier. Diagram of a proposed glacial curtain. Nature / Adapted by Yale Environment 360 Hugh Hunt, an engineering professor and deputy director of Cambridge’s Centre for Climate Repair, has another proposal. “We have been looking for ideas that involve less infrastructure,” he says. The most promising would replace a fabricated curtain with a more natural barrier. He proposes laying a pipe along the bed of the Amundsen Sea that would release a constant stream of either air bubbles or cold water pumped down from the surface. “A bubble barrier probably wouldn’t completely halt the flow of warm water,” he says. “But it would disturb that flow, creating turbulence that would force it to mix with the colder water above.” Offshore civil engineering companies already use bubble barriers to contain silt and protect marine life from their operations, Hunt says. A giant bubble machine off Antarctica would require a continuous supply of energy, which would have to be renewable. “With no winter sunlight, solar power wouldn’t work,” he says. “But offshore wind farms would. And with long-distance submarine cabling improving all the time, we could even generate power far away.” Moore calls the bubble barrier a “wild card.” But, he says, “it is great they are pursuing it, because the potential payoff is huge.” Its main problem right now, he says, is that it remains almost entirely unresearched. An Antarctic curtain would be hugely expensive, but far less than the cost to protect coastlines from rising tides. There are other glacier-protecting strategies that avoid the need for curtains or other barriers. Slawek Tulaczyk, a glaciologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has proposed stabilizing the two imperiled glaciers by draining the meltwaters that currently seep to their base, lubricating the pinning points and accelerating the glaciers’ seaward flow. By drilling holes through the glaciers and inserting pumps, engineers could dry up the lubricant and bring that flow to a halt. The extracted water could then be sprayed across the glacier surface, where it would freeze, helping to rebuild the glacier. Are such ideas feasible, how much would they cost, and what are the ethics of all this? Moore puts the likely bill for erecting a curtain across the Amundsen Sea at up to $80 billion. That is a lot of money. But much less, he says, than the trillions of dollars that might be needed to protect coastlines from rising tides caused by the loss of the two glaciers. Others question this analysis. “I don’t doubt we could spend a decade building the curtain,” says Twila Moon, a glaciologist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado. “It is a naturally attractive idea that one big project can make the difference. But curtains may just displace the heat elsewhere, melting other ice.” In any event, she says, sea-level rise would continue as a result of factors such as thermal warming of the oceans, land subsidence, and changes in ocean circulation, as well as the melting of other land ice, such as on Greenland. “So the question is whether this is the right place to put our resources, including limited research funding.” The Thwaites Glacier, photographed on a research flight. U.S. Antarctic Program Her Colorado colleague and Thwaites Glacier expert Scambos is more open to geoengineering research, but still skeptical. “I think the ideas are worth pursuing,” he says. “We could explore them at a meaningfully large scale in sites with low negative consequences if things don’t go well.” But, like Moon, he fears the impact on climate policymaking. In an ideal world, Scambos says, “we could pursue engineering solutions for the poles while at the same time directly decarbonizing our societies.” But the world isn’t like that. Climate negotiators at the UN COP28 meeting last December “brought up the notion that decarbonizing could go slower now that these [geoengineering] ideas are out there,” Scambos says. “The idea that ‘scientists are working on the problem’ could be a death knell for the 22nd century.” Moore has heard these criticisms. “Yes, there is opposition,” he says. “We need to address that. We need a social licence.” He agrees that there are other important causes of current and future sea-level rise. But “none of these other sources have the potential to raise sea level at the extreme rates and magnitudes that could be realized from a rapid marine ice sheet collapse.” If the glaciers are past their tipping points, dooming the world’s coastal lands, he says, we may have no alternative but to bite the geoengineering bullet. And the sooner we get started, he says, the better.","Glaciers in West Antarctica are particularly vulnerable because they are not sitting on solid land.

The Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center at The Ohio State University Scientists have unearthed the remnants of more than 1,700 viruses from deep inside a glacier in western China. Most of these viruses are new to science. With this discovery, the number of ancient viruses recovered from glaciers has grown fiftyfold. The viruses, gathered from a 1,000-foot ice core taken from the sprawling Guliya Glacier on the Tibetan Plateau, date back 41,000 years and span three major shifts from cold to warm. Scientists say the viruses differed markedly between colder and warmer eras, noting that a distinct community of viruses formed during the most dramatic of these climatic shifts, at the end of the last ice age some 11,500 years ago. “This at least indicates the potential connection between viruses and climate change,” said ZhiPing Zhong of Ohio State University, lead author on the research. Scientists posit that warming eliminated some resident viruses and that changing winds brought in new viruses from as far away as the Arctic and the Middle East. Glacial viruses likely infected other microbes, sending ripples up the food chain. Researchers say that viruses recovered from glaciers could shed light on how life evolved through past changes in climate and help clarify , for instance, whether ancient forests or wetlands were carbon sinks or sources. Their findings were published in Nature Geoscience . While researchers have warned that some dormant viruses now being liberated from melting glaciers could potentially infect humans, the viruses unearthed from the Guliya glacier pose no risk, study authors said. They emphasized the need to gather more such viruses before glaciers melt away.

In 2023, the fires were even larger. Such devastation has prompted scientists and planners to ask how the world’s most fire-prone continent can prepare for future megafires. Today, they’re drawing both inspiration and lessons from Indigenous peoples, who have been lightly burning the land for some 60,000 years.  Filmmaker Kirsten Slemint followed James Shaw — of the Melukerdee tribe of the South East Nations — as he trained young Indigenous people to execute cultural burns on Tasmania’s Bruny Island. Burning the land at low temperatures, he says, reduces the fuel load and provides nutrients for the plants and seeds under the ash. Notes conservation biologist Hugh Possingham, “The whole system evolved with Indigenous burning. It’s one of the cultures that humanity needs to learn from in the coming years if we’re actually going to stabilize this planet.” Asked what inspired her to focus a film on cultural burning in Australia, Slemint said, “Australia is not alone in facing devastating wildfires, and it has a wealth of knowledge and experience to offer the global community. I think the film’s messages of respect, community, and hope are critical to creating a brighter future — where both our environmental and cultural heritage are protected and celebrated.” About the Filmmaker: A recent graduate of Britain’s National Film and Television School, Kirsten Slemint is a freelance filmmaker and producer based in London.

Asian Development Bank China appears to be tapping the brakes on coal. The amount of new coal power approved so far this year is down 80 percent from the same period in 2023. From January through June, Chinese officials permitted 10.3 gigawatts of new coal capacity, far less than the 50.4 gigawatts approved in the first half of last year, according to an analysis from Greenpeace and the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies. While China is bullish on renewables — it is currently building twice as much wind and solar as the rest of the world combined — officials have been looking to coal to meet demand when solar and wind are in short supply. Over the last two years, China has permitted 197.1 gigawatts of new coal capacity, though the power sector may now be at a turning point, analysts say. “One question remains here. Are Chinese provinces slowing down coal approvals because they’ve already approved so many coal projects?” asked Gao Yuhe, project lead for Greenpeace East Asia. “Or are these the last gasps of coal power in an energy transition that has seen coal become increasingly impractical? Only time can tell.” So far this year, wind and solar generation has roughly equaled coal generation in China. With renewables set to further displace coal, it is possible that Chinese emissions peaked last year. But barriers remain to bringing more wind and solar online. China needs to build new transmission lines to convey clean power from where it is produced to where it is needed, so as to meet demand without ramping up coal power. While China plans to equip coal power plants , old and new, with technology to cut emissions, analysts say that, to reach its climate goals, the world’s biggest emitter should focus on upgrading its grid. “Amid powerful wind and solar growth, connecting these new energy sources to China’s old, outdated grid remains a hurdle,” Gao said. “Any money spent building new coal power plants should really be spent improving renewable grid connectivity.” ALSO ON YALE E360 How China Became the World’s Leader on Renewable Energy","The amount of new coal power approved so far this year is down 80 percent from the same period in 2023.

10696,2024-08-15 10:37:00,Yale Environment 360,https://e360.yale.edu/features/cities-flooding-combined-sewer-overflows-climate-change,"Faced With Heavier Rains, Cities Scramble to Control Polluted Runoff",Public Health & Environment,Sustainability,"In 2011, Philadelphia’s city-owned water utility drew national attention when it began Green City, Clean Waters , a 25-year program to manage an increasing volume of stormwater by using mostly “green infrastructure,” such as rain gardens and porous pavements, which allows rain to soak into the ground rather than becoming runoff that pollutes rivers and creeks. With a plan for green infrastructure to drain some 9,500 acres across the city, the Philadelphia Water Department was considered by many to be at the cutting edge of stormwater management — an increasingly urgent challenge for city governments amid the bigger, more frequent rainstorms now occurring as a result of climate change, especially in the northeastern United States. The program led Philadelphia and other U.S. cities to install nature-based solutions to absorb and filter rainfall alongside traditional “gray infrastructure,” such as pipes, tunnels, and pump stations. Yet while other cities, such as Milwaukee and Boston, saw green measures as complements to gray infrastructure, Philadelphia placed rain gardens and bioswales — vegetated ditches that collect stormwater — at the center of its strategy. But now, critics say, these innovations are proving inadequate at handling the increase in extreme rainfall events. In fact, the amount of overflow from pipes that combine stormwater with raw sewage has actually increased since the Green Cities program began. Gray infrastructure can take decades to implement and cost billions of dollars, but many cities don’t have much of a choice. An average of 14 billion gallons of polluted stormwater have overflowed from Philadelphia’s 164 sewage outfall pipes each year since Green City, Clean Waters began, according to “Unraveling the Facts” a new report from the Restore the River Advocacy Team, a group of water experts and environmentalists that includes the former heads of the interstate Delaware River Basin Commission and the Camden County Municipal Utilities Authority, which manages wastewater in the southern New Jersey county. “Because of climate change, the city’s targets for sewage pollution reduction” — slashing combined sewer overflows by approximately 8 billion gallons a year from the 2006 baseline of 13 billion gallons — “are no longer connected to the reality of the climate induced rainfall conditions Philadelphia is actually experiencing,” the report states. Roughly 700 municipalities in the U.S. rely on combined sewer systems, mostly in the Northeast and around the Great Lakes, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. These cities and towns are taking a hard look at updated climate projections that show an increase in heavy rainfall, and many are doubling down on gray infrastructure projects, which include concrete holding tanks, tunnels, and pipes that can divert and hold onto combined flows until the rain stops and treatment plants recover. Such projects can take decades to implement and cost billions of dollars — green infrastructure is both cheaper and faster to build — but many cities are finding they don’t have much of a choice. Tree planters on Osage Avenue in Philadelphia that were designed to absorb stormwater. Philadelphia Department of Water In Milwaukee, the Metropolitan Sewerage District, which serves 1.1 million people, relies on both green and gray infrastructure. But its storage tunnels and tanks have done the most to reduce combined sewer overflows into Lake Michigan and local rivers, said Kevin Shafer, the district’s executive director. He estimated that the system’s gray infrastructure can currently handle two and a half to three inches of rain at a time, while green measures can absorb only about half an inch. Still, he calls green infrastructure “the icing on the cake” because managing water where it falls protects water bodies from contaminants like bacteria, heavy metals, and trash, and it reduces the risk of basement backups. “You have to have both,” he said. Despite its limited finances and aging infrastructure, Milwaukee’s sewerage district has set a goal of eliminating combined sewer overflows (CSOs) by 2035. “With the changing climate we’re facing,” Shafer has said, “it’s like running uphill, and the hill keeps getting steeper and steeper.” Boston, too, has emphasized gray infrastructure in its efforts to upgrade stormwater management. The city is operating under a long-term control plan — a federal mandate to reduce CSO volumes until waterways are in compliance with the Clean Water Act, which set a goal for all rivers and creeks to be “fishable and swimmable.” To meet those goals, the city is, little by little, separating stormwater from sewage lines so that rainwater flows into creeks and rivers, leaving only sewage in pipes that lead to treatment plants. The city is also directing stormwater, before it overflows into waterways, into “partial treatment facilities” that screen out trash and other solids, then disinfect water with high doses of chlorine before discharging it through outfall pipes. Alexandria’s new tunnel is designed to reduce the number of overflows per year from 70, during the 2000 to 2016 period, to four. But according to Max Rome, stormwater program manager for the nonprofit Charles River Watershed Association, the control plan’s current goal may be impossible to meet. In 2023, for example, Boston received about 55 inches of rain, somewhat more than in a typical year, but some 70 million gallons of combined sewage and stormwater entered the the Charles River, about five times the amount allowed by the long-term control plan. Last year’s overflows reflect the increasing intensity of downpours that overwhelm wastewater treatment plants, said Rome. “It’s a perfect example of how climate change is changing precipitation. It wasn’t that much wetter, but more of the precipitation fell during a smaller [number] of storms.” In cooperation with the EPA, Boston is now revising its long-term control plan for the lower Charles River watershed with an overflow limit of some 38 million gallons a year, based on 2050’s projected rainfall, said Rome, citing unpublished data from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority. That’s above the watershed’s current 13-million-gallon limit but below the actual overflows of the last few years, he says, suggesting that even the revised target will be hard to meet. Increased rainfall is also affecting Western cities, including Portland, Oregon, which sharply reduced pollution in the downtown section of the Willamette River and Columbia Slough by building three tunnels to hold stormwater flows. The project, which nearly eliminated CSOs, took 20 years to complete, in 2011, and cost $1.4 billion. Yale Environment 360 Utilities pay for such upgrades through increased water rates and federal grants. The Biden administration’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, passed in 2021, is currently providing funds for stormwater control measures. In Alexandria, Virginia, the city’s wastewater authority increased the diameter of a new wastewater tunnel from 10 feet to 12 feet based on a federal projection that the city will see rainfall increasing, from an annual average of 41 inches, between 2000 and 2016, to an annual average of almost 70 inches by 2100. The 2.2-mile-long tunnel, completed at a cost of $615 million but not due to begin operating until early 2026, will reduce sewage and stormwater overflows into the Potomac River from 140 million gallons a year, between 2000 and 2016, to 17 million gallons a year, said Justin Carl, chief executive of AlexRenew, the city’s public wastewater treatment authority. Alexandria’s new tunnel is designed to reduce the number of overflows per year from 70, during the 2000 to 2016 period, to four. The project includes some green infrastructure, like bioretention basins and tree wells that filter and retain stormwater runoff. But the agency decided to limit those measures because most of its CSOs occur in the oldest part of the city, which has little open space and clayey soils, which have a slow infiltration rate when moist. Only one site in Washington was suitable for nature-based solutions because it had low overflow and wasn’t densely developed. A much larger stormwater project is planned for the nation’s capital, where DC Water, an independent local-government authority, is building an 18-mile network of tunnels to hold 249 million gallons of stormwater and sewage until it can be safely pumped to a treatment plant. When completed later this decade, the system will reduce combined sewer overflows by 96 percent, said Moussa Wone, DC Water’s vice president for the Clean Rivers Program. The volume of CSO outflows into three urban waterways is expected to decline to an average of 138 million gallons a year from 3.2 billion gallons in 1996, and to cut the number of overflows to four from 82 over the same period. Green infrastructure is just a small part of the overall project, costing $98 million out of a total budget of $3.29 billion, Wone said. The agency conducted green-infrastructure pilot projects at two sites and concluded that only one, in Rock Creek Park, was suitable for nature-based solutions because it had low overflow volumes and wasn’t densely developed. Acknowledging the climate challenges faced by U.S. cities, the Philadelphia Water Department (PWD) in 2022 issued a 182-page report projecting a 9.5 percent increase in average annual rainfall by 2050, over the 1997-2017 baseline, and stated that stormwater management projects — whether gray or green — must be upgraded to reflect that scenario. Workers upgrade the combined sewer system in northeast Washington, D.C. to hold more stormwater and sewage, April 2021. Drew Angerer / Getty Images “PWD recognizes the issue; what they’re resisting is applying that in any way until the Green Cities plan is completed in 2036,” said Nick Pagon, an author of the Unraveling the Facts report who founded Philadelphia Waterborne, a program that taught teens to build boats on the Delaware River. “They don’t want anything that smells of reopening the long-term control plan.” The Philadelphia Water Department says it designs stormwater-control measures in light of climate-driven rainfall patterns, but it needs at least 30 years of data — the Green Cities program started in 2006 — to draw conclusions about those patterns. “Naturally variable precipitation patterns have been a known challenge for centuries, and now climate change impacts are pushing the wide range of possible rainfall amounts upward by some uncertain amount,” the agency said in a statement. “Making changes to programmatic targets and assumptions using only the past few years of observed data is unwise.” But John Rumpler, an attorney with the nonprofit Environment America, said cities across the country must accept the need to make large investments to control increasing stormwater flows. “We are going to need to bite the bullet and make large-scale investments in conventional sewage infrastructure and repairs to stop these billions of gallons of raw sewage from running into rivers,” he said. “The increased storms connected to climate change are just making the task all that much more daunting and underscoring the need for greater investments in wastewater infrastructure.”","Philadelphia began a 25-year program to manage an increasing volume of stormwater by using mostly “green infrastructure,’ such as rain gardens.

Keith Williams via Flickr Scientists have found new evidence that melting Arctic permafrost could unleash large sums of mercury, a dangerous toxin. Scientists estimate that the amount of mercury in the atmosphere has grown sevenfold over the last 500 years, primarily from burning coal. Air currents are carrying airborne mercury toward the Arctic, where it is absorbed by plants, which then deposit the toxin in the soil. Over centuries, mercury has built up in the frozen ground, such that today, Arctic permafrost may hold more mercury than the atmosphere, the oceans, and every living organism combined. As the region warms, melting permafrost could liberate this buried mercury. “There could be this giant mercury bomb in the Arctic waiting to explode,” said Josh West , an environmental scientist at the University of Southern California and coauthor of the new study. Still, experts are uncertain how much mercury may be lurking in the Arctic, or how much is now flowing into waterways as permafrost begins to thaw. To shed light on the matter, scientists recently measured the toxin in riverbanks and sandbars on the Huslia and Yukon rivers in Alaska. Troublingly, their measurements lined up with the high end of previous estimates. Their findings were published in the journal Environmental Research Letters . The good news, scientists say, is that some of the mercury unleashed by permafrost is being buried in river sediment, though it’s not clear how much is being locked away.

Simon Harrod via Flickr Researchers have found pharmaceuticals, from antidepressants to antibiotics, in rivers in all 10 national parks in England. While levels in parks were lower than those commonly found in urban rivers, the Peak District and Exmoor national parks were more heavily polluted than London, researchers found. In these parks, antibiotics are concentrated enough to give rise to antibiotic-resistant bacteria, putting swimmers at risk of contracting hard-to-treat infections. In the Peak District and Exmoor, as well as the Lake District, South Downs, and the New Forest, pharmaceutical levels were so high as be to potentially harmful to wildlife, according to the study , published in the journal Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry. Parks often have old wastewater treatment plants that do a poor job of filtering out pharmaceuticals, researchers said, and during summer, parks see a rush of visitors who worsen pollution, either by ingesting pharmaceuticals and then urinating them or by throwing out unused medications.

European Space Agency Warming loaded the dice for fire weather — hot, dry conditions that leave forests ripe for burning — in Canada and in part of the Amazon last year, according to a new report. Scientists determined that climate change increased the odds of fire weather in Canada threefold and in the Amazon twentyfold. It is “virtually certain” that fires in both regions were larger as a result of warming, said report coauthor Chantelle Burton, a climate scientist with the U.K. Met Office. Fires in Canada were particularly severe, burning an area roughly the size of Alabama and unleashing an unprecedented volume of emissions. “In Canada, almost a decade’s worth of carbon emissions from fire were recorded in a single fire season,” said lead author Matthew Jones, a climate scientist at the University of East Anglia. The report , the first edition in a new annual review of fires, finds that global emissions from wildfires last year were 16 percent higher than the historical average. Last year would have set a record for fire emissions were it not for the unusually quiet season on the African savannah. The findings were published in Earth System Science Data.

But their numbers swooned with the arrival of settlers, who plowed their grasslands and set poison baits for canine predators. In the 1980s, conservationists began reintroducing foxes in Montana’s Blackfeet and Fort Peck Indian reservations, but these animals haven’t connected with populations to the south.  Now, members of the Aaniiih and Nakoda tribes are working with biologists to reintroduce 30 to 40 swift foxes a year, for five years, to the Fort Belknap reservation. “The hope is that the foxes continue to expand into their former range and eventually connect the two disconnected populations,” says filmmaker Roshan Patel. Based on observations and genetic information from stool samples, scientists believe the foxes are establishing new dens, finding mates, and successfully raising litters. Patel was drawn to this story by the tribes’ relationship to the swift fox, which they consider a missing puzzle piece in the larger ecosystem of the plains. “It wasn’t a story about a scientific argument solely. There was a human connection driving all the efforts to bring foxes back to Fort Belknap,” he says. “I hope viewers appreciate the importance of community in conservation efforts.” About the Filmmaker: Roshan Patel is an award-winning wildlife and conservation filmmaker whose work often focuses on the relationship between communities and their wildlife.

11080,2024-10-12 15:00:00,Grist,https://grist.org/politics/from-the-lab-to-the-legislature-stem-professionals-run-for-political-office/,From the lab to the legislature: STEM professionals run for political office,Politics & Law,Public Health & Environment,"In one of this year’s primary elections, a physicist and science educator took to the campaign trail. Ramón Barthelemy , a physics and astronomy education researcher at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, was pursuing a seat in the Utah House of Representatives to represent District 24. He challenged 15-year incumbent and fellow Democrat Joel Briscoe for the opportunity to represent more than 43,000 residents of Salt Lake City. More than 200 STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) professionals like Barthelemy are running for office at the state and municipal level this year, more than ever before. Though races at the top of the ticket rightly receive a lot of attention, the results of down-ballot races determine many of the policies that affect people’s daily lives, including how federal policies are implemented at the local or state level. Barthelemy’s campaign targeted the value of science education and literacy in his district, and he believed his background as a scientist could help increase access to STEM education, improve local air quality, and encourage local students to pursue STEM careers at nearby tech companies. “I think it is critical, now more than ever, that we have scientists engaged in the political process,” Barthelemy said. “The challenges we are faced with — not just as a state, not just as a country, but as a species — are technical and scientific, and we need technical expertise in order to solve them.” Climate change, pollution, ethical technology development, energy independence, the space race, public health: Solving these problems requires a partnership between scientists, who have the expertise to understand these issues, and politicians, who have the resources and influence to enact solutions. More and more, scientists are choosing to engage more deeply in the political process and run for office themselves. Though science-based facts are not the be-all, end-all when crafting policy, this engagement brings scientific knowledge and problem-solving skills into legislative chambers at all levels of governance and gives science and its practitioners a greater voice in the political process. “So many of the big issues that we face as a nation, communities, and world have science at their core.…For us to not be part of [solving these issues] is a huge mistake,” said Kristopher Larsen , who helps manage data collection for Mars missions at the University of Colorado Boulder’s Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics and is a former mayor of Nederland, Colorado. Scientists run for office for reasons as varied and individual as the scientists themselves. Some have always felt called to public service and see governance as a way to give back to their communities. Some become concerned that officials have failed to act on climate change or other issues with science-based solutions. “Whether you care about our nuclear policy, or climate change, or health care, or education, we benefit by having scientists as part of those discussions,” said Shaughnessy Naughton , founder and president of 314 Action , a political action fund that helps scientists run for office in the United States. “Any issue benefits by having scientists at the governing table,” she said. Still others, including Barthelemy, have grown concerned with rising anti-science and anti-education sentiment in the United States and feel they are in a unique position to combat it. They chose to fight back on politicians’ turf. “There are a lot of people who believe that science can help us live better lives and that science really does need to be front and center when we’re making public policy,” said Jess Phoenix , a volcanologist, science advocate, and former candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives. “We have to step up and say, ‘This is wrong. This is right. We have evidence and data to support that,’” Phoenix said. “There’s a whole group of people who really value science, and science needs champions.” The perceived lack of action to address climate change was one of the issues that drove Naughton, a former chemist, to campaign to represent Pennsylvania’s 8th District in the U.S. House in 2014. Naughton had also grown alarmed by attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the failure to combat gun violence — or even collect data on it — after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. Evidence-based solutions exist to stop climate change, reduce gun violence, and secure health care, so she felt that the lack of progress on these issues “wasn’t a problem with the science. This was a problem with policymakers. And the only way to fix that was to run for Congress,” she said, and champion science-based solutions in the halls of governance. The election of Donald Trump and his administration’s perceived efforts to undermine science were what prompted Phoenix to consider a run for office. “When Trump was elected,” she said, “it was a shock to the science ecosystem.” She was alarmed that the Trump administration was not just ignoring the best available science when it came to issues like climate change but also appearing to work counter to the best interests of both the public and the environment . “That really motivated me to step up and say, ‘Why can’t scientists run for office?’” Phoenix remembered. She announced her candidacy for a seat in the U.S. House representing what is now California’s 27th district at the 2017 March for Science . Although her campaign was unsuccessful — today, the district is represented by Mike Garcia (R-Santa Clarita) — she has continued her science advocacy by becoming an ambassador for the Union of Concerned Scientists. “People who represent us in government, especially at the federal level, are supposed to be drawn from a wide array of backgrounds,” Phoenix said, “but it’s mainly lawyers and career politicians, and you aren’t seeing janitors and nurses and scientists.” Larsen, who served as Nederland’s mayor between 2016 and 2022 and is currently a town trustee, took an early interest in politics and got involved in his community while working as a postdoc. He started by joining an advisory board that helps preserve open space and trails, which spoke to his love for skiing, mountain biking, and hiking. “This was my way to get to know how the town works,” he said. Nederland’s mayor and trustees oversee zoning issues, public works, community engagement, emergency service access, and sustainability efforts. In his small town (population: 1,500), “the politics we do doesn’t end up on the front page of the paper,” he said. Only occasionally do larger crises, like a wildfire or an attempted bombing in town, break the mold. From the new space race to climate change to COVID-19 , science has become more politicized than ever. Some scientist-candidates say their research-based approach is a strength when addressing issues both inside and outside the sphere of science. When Ben Dewell , a meteorologist and a director of the Stallion Springs Community Service District, first moved into California’s 20th District in 2015, “I didn’t make it known that I was a scientist.” The historically red district was represented by then-Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield). Dewell strongly objected to what he felt was McCarthy putting his loyalty to former President Trump over the interests of his constituents. Dewell initially ran for office in 2022 to unseat McCarthy, first as a Democrat and then again as a No Party candidate. With the encouragement of his neighbors, he organized a campaign on his own without the assistance of local organizing groups or political action committees. “I was less than grassroots, and to this day, it’s still less than grassroots,” he joked about his campaign. “It’s not even a seedling.” Although his congressional campaign was unsuccessful, Dewell still feels that his scientific, data-driven way of looking at issues is an asset in his hyperpartisan district, today represented by Vince Fong (R-Bakersfield). “A lot of people who have come up to me [have] said, ‘I didn’t know you were a scientist. What do you do?’” Dewell said. “And I’ve explained it to them, and they’ve smiled” encouragingly. Dewell also serves on the board of the Eastern Kern Air Pollution Control District that monitors the district’s air quality and is currently running for a seat on the Kern County Board of Supervisors in a November special election. “It would have been inconsistent for me not to run in service to the same constituency still in need of a logical, rational, nonpartisan voice,” he said. “My ballot designation still includes ‘scientist.’” Brianna Titone (D), a geochemist who flipped her Colorado district from red to blue in 2018, felt that her background as a scientist was a real asset to her campaign. “My district has a lot of engineers and a lot of scientists,” she said. Colorado House of Representatives District 27 represents thousands of people who work at scientific institutions, including the Colorado School of Mines, the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and a U.S. Geological Survey center. But as a first-time candidate, a Democrat, and a trans woman running in a red district, Titone was at a disadvantage when pitted against the incumbent GOP candidate. Her experience as a consultant on groundwater flow for the mining industry and a geology software engineer provided a way for her to engage with constituents on familiar ground. “I really relied a lot on my scientific background to talk to my voters,” she said. However, she also acknowledged that public trust of science was greater when she was elected than it is now. “There is a subset of the population that is distrustful,” Phoenix said. “But what we have found among swing voters is that there is a lot of trust of science, scientists, and expertise in general. And that really bodes well for our country’s future and for scientific candidates.” Although the number has declined since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, 73 percent of Americans still have confidence in scientists to act in the public’s best interests. “For a lot of voters, as crazy as it sounds, [being a scientist] is almost a value statement,” Phoenix explained. “Because people look at scientists as truth tellers, as honest brokers, and that’s really what they want from their elected leaders.” The scientific community has expressed mixed reactions to scientists entering the political arena. Many scientist-candidates recall receiving relieved looks, at best, or negative pushback, at worst, from their fellow scientists. The feelings of relief sometimes come from scientists who want to have a greater voice in government but are not in a position to run for office themselves, Phoenix explained. Running a campaign for federal office, for instance, requires a significant investment of time and money, and actually holding that office is a full-time career. Running for a local position is less expensive but can be just as time-consuming, and though these positions are often part-time, their lower pay often necessitates holding a second job. As such, the responsibilities of running for and holding office can discourage scientists (and those in most professional communities) who are early in their career, are seeking tenure, are the primary earner in their household, have family caregiving responsibilities, or experience bias because of their identity. “Admittedly, I was pretty naive about the process,” Naughton said. Although her congressional campaign was unsuccessful, it led her to found 314 Action, which has helped elect more than 400 scientists to public office at all levels of governance. She wanted to provide scientists with the tools, resources, and knowledge base that she lacked when she first ran for office. When you want to run for office but lack the privilege, Phoenix said, seeing someone else step up can be a relief. “When I tell other scientists I’m running for office,” Barthelemy said, “their eyes get wide, and they’re just like, ‘Oh, I’m so glad you’re doing that. I could never do that. Good luck!’” Naughton said she sees a generational divide in how scientists react to their colleagues running for office. “Especially among the younger generation, there’s a strong appetite for getting involved in politics,” she said. Among the older generation of scientists, the feeling seemed to be “science is above politics, and therefore, scientists shouldn’t be involved in politics.” There is some historical basis for that opinion. The U.S. public has not always looked kindly on scientists who have become the face of a scientific issue, whether willingly or not. Consider J. Robert Oppenheimer and the atomic bomb or Michael Mann and climate change or Anthony Fauci and COVID-19. Scientists have seen many examples where politicians and the public have turned on outspoken colleagues, and some advise students to “stay in their lane,” Naughton said. “That model has failed us,” Naughton continued, because whereas scientists may be hesitant to enter the political arena, “politicians are unembarrassed and unafraid to meddle in science.” “Yes, it would be great if we could just be in our bubble doing our work,” Phoenix added, “but unfortunately, that is not the case.” Say you’re a scientist with an interest in politics and you care about a particular issue in your community. Is running for office necessarily the answer? “I’m going to say, flatly, ‘no’ to all scientists,” Dewell said. “I would like to see more pure scientists in there… I would say they should run if they feel like they can make a difference” while remaining objective. Whether or not a scientist should run for office “would depend on whether I felt that scientist was going to do a good job in the political arena,” said Samuel Bell , a planetary geologist at the Planetary Science Institute and a Rhode Island state senator. What drove Bell (D) into politics was a desire to see the Democratic party fight harder for science funding and use science-based decision-making to craft laws. Scientists are not a monolith. A scientific background is no guarantee that a person would make a good legislator or be a good advocate for their community or for science. Instead of seeking to become policymakers, many scientists apply their expertise in advisory positions, working in government agencies, or through science advocacy groups to serve their communities. Being elected to office is not the only way a scientist can effect change . What’s more, politics, just like geoscience, is a specialized field that requires specialized training. Such training programs exist, as do organizations like 314 Action that help scientists overcome barriers to entering politics. Naughton urged scientists not to be discouraged by the challenges of running for office. “We are trying to normalize the idea of public service with science,” she said. “There are ways to serve your community that don’t require giving up your career or taking a pay cut,” she continued. “A lot of municipal and even state legislative positions are part-time and are meant to be served part-time while you continue with your career.” Larsen, too, encouraged scientists to participate more directly in politics. “If you’re not involved, you don’t have a voice,” he said. “Then we’re just leaving it to people who don’t understand science at all to make the decisions for science.” Still, Bell feels that there’s a lot of overlap in what it takes to be a scientist and what it takes to be a politician. “Politics is very high stakes, just like the sciences, and it’s very competitive, just like sciences,” he said. Neither career pays the most or has the most job security. “It’s important for you to have the [conviction] in what you’re fighting for, in what’s right, the same way as in science,” he said. But just as a scientist shouldn’t jump blithely into a new research area without doing a literature review, they should do their research before entering politics, Titone advised. “Don’t set foot in city hall or the state house for the first time after you win an election,” she said. “You should set foot in those places well before that so you have an understanding of what the process is like, how people speak to each other, what some of the topics are, and how they cover them.” “Then,” she added, “if you have a specific expertise on a specific topic, think about what things that you bring to the table that you can do to help solve some of the problems that are facing your area.” But how does being a scientist actually help with being a lawmaker? For most geoscientists, their specific research topic is rarely, if ever, relevant. Bell, who researches planetary impacts, joked that “there have not been major [impactors] that have struck the state of Rhode Island. And I really hope that that will continue to be the case!” However, he recalled using his scientific expertise to advocate for a constituent whose home had been damaged by roadwork-driven seismicity. “The unique geology of the neighborhood in which she lived led to a much greater risk of seismic damage than would normally be the case,” he said. Instead, scientists have found that the generalized skills developed when earning a science degree —critical thinking, asking tough questions, independent learning, collaboration, and teaching others — have served them the most when in office. Larsen recalled that during his time as Nederland’s mayor, he ran on and spent time in office pushing for wildfire and climate resilience. These were issues in which, as a Mars researcher, he did not have direct scientific expertise but were critically important to the town’s residents. Larsen’s attention to those issues gained him recognition from Pete Buttigieg’s 2020 presidential campaign. He served briefly as a climate adviser for the campaign. Bell, too, said that his general scientific training really helped him to understand issues specific to his constituency. His skills allowed him “to punch through and question a lot of the industry propaganda,” for example, when it came to the physics involved in a proposed expansion of a natural gas pipeline in Rhode Island. A lot of the information about the pipeline was “quite shockingly wrong,” Bell said. “And when it’s dressed up in fancy language from official reports, a lot of people won’t know the difference between totally garbage science and reasonable science.” His research skills helped him ask industry representatives piercing questions, though ultimately, the pipeline expansion was approved . After several years in office, Titone found that her analytical approach to science-related legislation led her to “really earn the trust of my colleagues because they know that I know technology. I know the lingo. I understand some of the nuance and math,” she said. “Those skills have really helped me explain to people something that’s complex in a way that they can understand it.” In fact, being a generalist is critical when it comes to making science- and data-driven decisions. “As senators, we’re called on to legislate on everything under the Sun,” U.S. Senator John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), wrote in a statement to Eos . “We cover so much, so quickly, it helps to have some prior knowledge you bring to the table to understand the topics a little deeper.” Hickenlooper, a former geologist with a master’s degree in Earth and environmental sciences, is the only Earth scientist currently serving in the U.S. Senate. “A facts-first approach is also something every senator should be using,” Hickenlooper wrote. “More scientists in government would help defuse the tensions and partisanship on many issues.” But gathering facts and following logic are only the first steps to solving problems. Despite dreaming of purely science-based lawmaking, many scientists-turned-politicians have found that they need to balance other factors such as equity and cost when crafting even technical policies. A science-based solution to a problem might be cut and dry (for example, cutting carbon emissions to stop climate change); implementing that solution is often far from straightforward. Incremental progress is often more feasible, if a bit less palatable to a novice politician. Public office is about doing what’s best for your community, Larsen said, and that means collaboration and cooperation, two critical skills for a scientist. “In mainstream news, politics is laid out as a very adversarial thing. It’s always red versus blue, right versus left. Pick your dichotomy,” he said. “But when you actually are in it and trying to get things done, it’s finding the compromise and finding the ways to do something that’s going to work for as many people as possible and make progress.” “Fighting is the first thing I had to unlearn,” he added. Eos repeatedly reached out to several GOP politicians with STEM backgrounds for this article but did not receive any replies. Though Barthelemy lost his June 25 primary challenge, he reflected that the process gave him a new stage to talk to people about STEM education, air quality in Salt Lake City, and the drying of the Great Salt Lake. Despite the election’s outcome, he found it to be a valuable experience. “I think it’s critical to just even be part of the conversation so we can increase the discourse on the importance of science and also the importance of scientific literacy amongst the population,” Barthelemy said. Regardless of your scientific background or political leanings, “when you get elected, you have to represent everyone, even the people who disagree with you,” Phoenix said. “And if you’re a scientist, that means people who think that what you work on is baloney.” “Political parties are not mentioned anywhere in the U.S. Constitution,” Dewell noted. “ Science is .” ","More than 200 STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) professionals are running for office at the state and municipal level this year. Scientists run for office for reasons as varied and individual as the scientists themselves. “Any issue benefits by having scientists at the governing table,” said Shaughnessy Naughton, founder and president of 314 Action, a political action fund that helps scientists run for Office. ‘We have to step up and say, ‘This is wrong.

11208,2024-10-12 16:47:01,The Independent,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/trail-fox-hunting-ban-labour-law-b2624103.html,"Why banning trail-hunting might not stop foxes, deer and hares from being killed",Wildlife & Conservation,Public Health & Environment,"Banning trail- hunting as Labour promised will not stop hunts from killing foxes and deer because hunters would find other ways around the law, a new report warns. The report, entitled ‘Broken Law – How the Hunting Act has Failed’, was drawn up by hunting opponents who claim the law is too easily abused, leaving wildlife with too little protection. This December marks 20 years since the Hunting Act was passed, before coming into force two months later. Labour promised in its general election manifesto to end trail hunting, which involves following a scent trail laid by an animal or artificially. The aim is to replicate a traditional hunt without harming the animal and is not currently covered by the Hunting Act. But activists from Action Against Foxhunting set out 23 recommendations on how the law should be amended to make it effective – including banning hounds from all private property without landowner permission. The report, seen by The Independent and which will be sent to environment secretary Steve Reed, other MPs and the National Wildlife Crime Unit, bases its findings on 25 cases in which a fox, stag, mink or hare was chased or killed by a hunt. Of those, 11 cases were dropped either by police or the Crown Prosecution Service and did not lead to a prosecution, and 12 resulted in a prosecution but a not guilty verdict. Several cases failed because the prosecution “could not prove beyond all reasonable doubt” that the person in control of the hounds intended to hunt a wild mammal. “All a huntsman has to do when his hounds are pursuing a fox is to look in the other direction and he knows he will have a viable defence,” the report states. It cites a case in Yorkshire when a fox was chased and badly wounded. A villager described to the court how hounds ran around “causing chaos and fear” and he said he was “in fear of being bitten”. The hounds ran around a field whose owner had previously asked the hunt not to enter his property. The hunt master assured him they would leave but later, the hounds chased a fox through the resident’s garden. He described the animal as being “in the most horrific state I have ever seen a fox, covered from its shoulders to the tip of its nose in blood”. Hounds chased after it, and the witness said he put up his arms to stop three approaching riders but that one accelerated, forcing him to jump out of the way. The defence submitted no case to answer, arguing the hounds “were not under the control of any human”, so intent to hunt could not be proven. The judge said the Hunting Act was difficult to interpret and apply, and difficult for the CPS to prosecute under. It also cites other cases where police dropped their investigation because the hunt said killing the fox was an accident. In another case, a judge believed the hunt guilty on the balance of probability, but could not deliver that verdict because the test was “beyond reasonable doubt”. The prosecuting barrister said: “The same quality of evidence in a murder trial would have led to an easy conviction.” Pip Donovan, one of the report’s authors, said: “We are terrified the government will get it wrong, and we’ll have another 20 years of killing in the countryside, so instead of starting with the Hunting Act and suggesting changes based on theory, we are starting with events in the field and trying to find a way to put a stop to the killing forever. Just banning trail-hunting won’t cut it. “The Act doesn’t ban hunting – it enables it because, after the first line about hunting with dogs, everything else is allowed. “The report will also be very good for police training. No one else has created this album of failed cases.” The recommendations include: The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was contacted for comment.","Labour promised in its general election manifesto to end trail hunting.

11336,2024-10-12 15:22:20,The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/12/stop-pushing-heat-pumps-backlash-green-energy-magnate-labour-ulez,"Stop pushing heat pumps or face major backlash, green energy magnate tells Labour",Energy,Sustainability,"The government risks a huge political backlash if it keeps pushing the public to install heat pumps to replace their boilers, one of Britain’s leading green entrepreneurs has warned. Dale Vince , a major Labour donor and renewable energy advocate, called on Keir Starmer to rethink national programmes, championed by Boris Johnson , pushing the technology. Vince argued that Whitehall should explore alternatives to the devices, which he said were expensive, caused serious disruption and could end up increasing energy bills for some people. Vince, whose criticism of heat pumps has proved divisive among environmentalists, said mass use could bring a bigger political backlash than London’s expanded ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), which led to a surprise byelection defeat for Labour last year in Uxbridge and South Ruislip. “It’s a Johnson-era policy, and like most Johnson ideas, it wasn’t thought through,” Vince said. “It wasn’t meant for the real world, if you look at the amount of money committed. Electricity energy bills overall in our households will go up unless you assume heroic levels of performance. “You’ve got this incredible disruption of home life for tens of millions of people – the need to change heating systems for a lot of people, not just the boiler – and substandard outcomes in a lot of cases.” He added: “It’s politically threatening for any government to have a heat-pump programme. If you look back at the Ulez byelection and the fuss made about it in elements of the press, imagine a heat-pump programme where a household has just spent thousands of pounds on some technology that doesn’t do the job.” In June, Vince tweeted that heat pumps were like “ Ulez on steroids ”. The entrepreneur’s latest comments expose divides even among environmentalists about the best way to move home heating away from the burning of fossil fuels via a regular gas boiler. Critics such as Vince state that heat pumps could increase bills because the electricity used to run them costs far more than gas. A study by the independent Energy Saving Trust put the cost at £20 a year more than using a new A-rated gas boiler. However, new specialist heat pump tariffs could make them cheaper to run. Johnson’s government was an advocate of the technology, setting a goal of 600,000 new heat pumps a year by 2028. While installations in the UK have hit a record number this year, they have still only reached about 42,000 since January. Air-source heat pumps cost just over £12,500 to buy and install on average, about four to five times more than a gas boiler. But the government currently offers a £7,500 grant for households installing the technology. Vince claimed that he was speaking in the “national interest” in criticising heat pumps. He proposes an alternative – green gas , or biomethane, made from organic material, which his company Ecotricity develops. Other environmentalists claim that the amount of land needed to produce enough green gas would be unrealistic, lead to food insecurity and damage biodiversity . The Heat Pump Association, an industry body, insisted that the devices are a “proven, efficient, low-carbon heating solution which are readily available and scalable with the potential to reduce carbon emissions from heating by over 75% relative to fossil fuel heating systems”. “Electricity prices are higher than gas prices in the UK,” it said. “However, heat pumps use three to five times less energy. Well-installed heat pumps that operate efficiently and make use of flexible electricity tariffs will in the vast majority of cases save the consumer money in comparison to their existing heating system.” A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said of Vince’s concerns: “We do not recognise these claims. The energy shocks of recent years have shown the urgent need to upgrade British homes, and heat pumps are a critical technology for decarbonising heating. “Biomethane also has an important role in the transition to net zero as a green gas that can decarbonise gas supply, reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and increase energy security.” Vince also revealed plans to take advantage of the government’s decision to end the effective ban on onshore wind by “dusting off” a plan for 100 turbines in Gloucestershire, where his company is based, to power the county’s homes. He said they could ultimately be transferred to the council’s ownership, handing it both an asset and long-term income. “If they were owned by the local authority, the windmills would bring £7m a year into local authority coffers,” he said. “We will take the lead on this. We will find the sites, take them through planning and at some point in the future hope to work with local authorities to hand them over for public ownership.” Sign up to Observed","Dale Vince, a major Labour donor and renewable energy advocate, called on Keir Starmer to rethink national programmes pushing the technology. Vince argued that Whitehall should explore alternatives to the devices, which he said were expensive, caused serious disruption and could end up increasing energy bills for some people. He said mass use could bring a bigger political backlash than London’s expanded ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), which led to a surprise byelection defeat for Labour last year. In June, Vince tweeted that heat pumps were like “ Ulez on steroids ”.",http://res.cloudinary.com/drwsupfyj/image/upload/v1728745581/state-of-the-earth/news_photographs/stoppushingheatpumpsorfacemajorbacklashgreenenergymagnatetellslabour.jpg

I saw few signs of human life on the wild Nahanni and the muddy Liard. But once I got to the Mackenzie, which is part of the second longest river system on the continent, I had to make way for tugboats pulling giant barges filled with gas, heating fuel, dry food, and other supplies destined for roadless Indigenous communities downstream of the village of Wrigley, where the Mackenzie Highway, which begins in Alberta, ends. More than once on a cold misty night, I was awoken in my tent by the deafening blast of a tug’s horn. Nowadays, those horn blasts are far less frequent because the Mackenzie River, which flows northwest to the Arctic Ocean and is part of the second longest river system on the continent, is at times not deep enough to float those barges. In fact, the government-owned company that operates the tugs stopped service altogether this year when it became clear the river would not contain sufficient water — even in late spring, after river ice melted. In June, the Canadian Coast Guard announced its services, including the provision of on-the-water responses and maintenance of aids to navigation, were “impacted” for almost a thousand miles of river. With fresh and dried food, essential building supplies, and fuel now being flown in by plane, and prices skyrocketing, residents in the five communities in the Sahtu region are ramping up their demand for the Canadian government to build a $1 billion (Canadian) road and bridge — known as the Mackenzie Valley Highway project — that will serve as a lifeline and connect them with other communities and services in the south. Many are currently rationing fuel and bringing in food from the south while vacationing or undergoing medical exams and treatment. The Mackenize River has never been so low, and all signs suggest climate change will make the situation much worse. During earlier periods of low water, supplies were trucked north thousands of miles from the south along the Alaksa and Dempster highways, then barged in from the Arctic Ocean on the Mackenzie. But this workaround has never happened with water so low for so long, and all signs suggest climate change will make the situation much worse. “The big issue for people living up here is what is next year — and the years after that — going to bring as the climate continues to warm and dry out the river?” says Todd McCauley, who is leading the campaign for the road that his mother, a Dene Indigenous chief, advocated for many years ago. “If you look at the bay on the Mackenzie where the barges [from the Arctic Ocean] dock at Norman Wells, there’s no water. It’s nothing but mud.” “For a very long time, the North has been viewed as a source of resources — beaver, furs, timber, metals, oil and gas — all to be developed by southern companies, financed by southern banks, for the benefit of distant southern markets,” says Charles McNeely, a Fort Good Hope resident who is chairman of the Dene- and Metis-run Sahtu Secretariat, which is responsible for implementing a range of services for the region’s five communities. “In exchange for this, the North got dispossessed of our lands and resources, our families torn apart [by the residential school program], our culture and language discredited, and our children abused. Not exactly a fair exchange, was it? How about we try something different for a change?” The Dempster Highway cuts across a desolate stretch of northern Canada. Remote villages are pushing to build another such road to ship in essential goods. Brian Martin / Alamy Stock Photo Increasingly hot, dry weather, diminishing winter snowpack, and rapidly melting icefields have been reducing mid- to later-summer flows along most of the continent’s Arctic rivers for many years. While I was boating down the Alaska side of the Yukon River with retired U.S. Fish and Wildlife biologist Skip Ambrose this past June, he told me that he had never seen such low river levels over the 50 years he’s been surveying peregrine falcon nest sites there. The Great Slave Lake, the fifth largest lake in North America, which drains into the Mackenzie River, is also at a record low. But people living along the Yukon and Mackenzie rivers aren’t only dealing with the stresses of low water. High water levels, the result of melting far earlier in the year, are also causing disruptions. In 2021, flooding in the Hay, Mackenzie, and Little Buffalo river systems caused $40 million in damages. In 2023, rising water levels along the Yukon River at Eagle, Alaska, poured onto the streets and into a hotel. University of Saskatchewan water expert John Pomeroy suggests that northerners should brace themselves for the bigger rainstorms that climate change is bringing. Climate change is also accelerating the recession of glaciers and thawing permafrost and snowpacks earlier and in shorter bursts. “What we expect to see is much higher and earlier flows, higher flood peaks, and less water flowing in the hot days of summer,” he says, warning of severe consequences for water resources management and navigation. Conservationists worry that saying yes to the road will bolster the claims of other interests lobbying for roads in the Arctic. Pomeroy’s observation has been echoed by other studies, including one that recently calculated the stream flow in 486,493 pan-Arctic river reaches from 1984 to 2018. The scientists found significant changes in the rate and timing of river discharges during the spring melt of snow and ice and in summer stream intermittency. Scientists at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst recently combined field observations and numerical modeling to determine how 8.7 million square miles of the Arctic are likely to change over the next 80 years. They suggest that by 2100 there will be 25 percent more runoff in the far north from subsurface pathways and more rainfall, but less water flowing in late spring and summer. Yukon glaciers sliding out of the St. Elias icefield, among the most expansive in the world, have lost 22 percent of their surface area since 1958. The Brintnell Bologna Icefields in the Ragged Range of the Northwest Territories, which sends meltwater into the Mackenzie River system, are fading even faster. Yale Environment 360 For years, residents of the Sahtu have been demanding from the Canadian government a two-lane gravel highway of approximately 200 miles. The road was estimated to cost at least $700 million, and in 2018 the government allocated approximately $70 million to study its feasibility. But last February, Canada’s Environment Minister announced the government would no longer invest in major, new road construction. Money spent on asphalt and concrete, minister Steven Guilbeault said, would be “better invested into projects that will help fight climate change and adapt to its impacts.” After a public outcry, Northwest Territory’s member of parliament, Michael McLeod, quickly clarified that the Mackenzie Valley Highway was still on the table, as did Guilbeault. Still, conservationists worry that saying yes to the road will bolster the claims of other communities and mining interests that have been lobbying for roads in other regions of the Arctic. For example, mining companies and the Inuit in the Kitikmeot region of the central Arctic have pushed — unsuccessfully so far — for a port to be constructed along the Arctic coast with a road running from Bathurst Inlet to a complex of inland mines and mining exploration sites. Earlier this year, Nunavut, Canada’s self-governing Inuit territory, hired an engineering company to study the potential for a 450-mile road that would connect four western Hudson Bay communities. A separate 200-mile route to the more remote inland community of Baker Lake is also under consideration. Neither of these roads, nor the Mackenzie Valley Highway, could be built without significant federal funding. To understand why the federal government may be reluctant to fund Arctic roads, it’s helpful to understand the fate of other northern highways and what a rapidly warming Arctic will mean for such infrastructure. The people of the Sahtu have invested more in conservation and carbon capture than has any jurisdiction in the south. Opened to the public in 2017, the $300 million, 87-mile all-weather road from Inuvik to Tuktoyaktuk in Northwest Territories was supposed to bring tourists to the Inuvialuit town of Tuktoyaktuk and lower the cost of energy development along the Arctic coast. But few tourists undertake the long, punishing drive, and the oil and gas companies pulled out of the region before the road was even completed. Today, Tuktoyaktuk is slowly sliding into the sea due to rising sea levels, powerful storms surges, and rapidly thawing permafrost. Maintaining Arctic roads has also proved costly. Just a few years after the Inuvik to Tuk highway was completed, the government spent an additional $13.5 million to raise it in areas where permafrost had thawed. Climate-related maintenance costs for the Yukon’s highway network have risen by $169,000 per year , in constant 2021 dollars, since 1994. The Mackenzie Valley Highway is not likely to cause as many headaches, according to University of Alberta scientist Duane Froese, who has been conducting permafrost research in the Sahtu region for the past few years “There’s less permafrost and less ice-rich permafrost in comparison to the Inuvik to Tuk Highway,” he says. “Much of the route is along till plains that are unlikely in that region to host significant ground ice.” Left: A grocery store in Fort Good Hope, where a liter of milk costs $12. Right: Charles McNeely, chairperson of the Sahtu Secretariat Incorporated. Sahtu Secretariat Incorporated Conservation groups have been silent on this issue for a few reasons. First, the right-of-way for the Mackenzie road does not pass through critical wildlife corridors, as the Bathurst Inlet road would. Second, they don’t want to jeopardize their relationship with people of the western Arctic, as there is still much wilderness to protect there, and they need the Dene on their side as partners, as the Dene own and have rights to vast areas of land. The people of the Sahtu have already invested more in conservation and carbon capture than has any jurisdiction in the south. They agreed to allow a new national park — Nááts’ihch’oh — established on their territory. And organizations such as the Boreal Songbird Initiative and the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society have praised them for recently agreeing to protect 4,000 square miles of carbon-rich wetlands along the Ramparts River near Fort Good Hope. The Sahtu hope that the road will make it easier and cheaper to receive essential goods. But they also foresee economic opportunity, hoping that tourists, climbers, hikers, and paddlers travel to the new park and the region’s pristine mountain and tundra rivers. Road proponents like McCauley point to other reasons for building. A road would make it easier to clean up the piles of scrap metals, broken down vehicles, leaking batteries, and other toxic materials from mining and other development activity that have been accumulating in Indigenous communities along the Mackenzie, and in Inuit communities on the Arctic islands, for decades. “The first two roads” — the Dempster Highway and the Inuvik to Tuk road — “were built to take resources out of the North,” says McNeely, of the Sahtu Secretariat. The next one, which McNeely will call the Trudeau Road if the current prime minister approves it, “would bring the world into the North.”","The Mackenzie River, which flows northwest to the Arctic Ocean, is at times not deep enough to float barges.

Scientists noticed that trees in urban ecosystems showed far less damage than those in more rural areas. Their research , published in Frontiers in Plant Science , has shed light on a potential reason. “We noticed that, compared with natural ecosystems, tree leaves in most urban ecosystems generally show little sign of insect damage. We were curious as to why,” said the study’s author, Dr Shuang Zhang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. “In two of the most common tree species in Beijing, artificial light at night led to increased leaf toughness and decreased levels of leaf herbivory.” Artificial light from streetlights had a surprising effect on the leaves of trees surveyed. The scientists tested two common species of street tree in Beijing: Japanese pagoda and green ash trees. The pagoda trees have smaller, softer leaves that insects prefer to munch on. Researchers thought plants in areas with high levels of artificial light may focus on defense rather than growth, which would mean their leaves would be tougher, with more chemical defense compounds. To test the trees they found 30 sampling sites on main roads that are usually lit by streetlights all night. They measured the amount of light — illuminance — at each site and then tested the leaves of the trees for toughness. They tested almost 5,500 leaves for properties including size, toughness, water content, and levels of nutrients, and chemical defenses. If the leaves were larger, this would indicate that plants directed their energy to growth of leaves, but if they were tough and contained tannins or other chemical defenses this would indicate that they had allocated their energy to defend themselves. They found that the more illuminance there was, the tougher the leaves. In the areas lit the brightest at night, the leaves were extremely tough and showed no sign of insects munching on them. Researchers said that while they did not completely understand why this happened, they suggested trees exposed to artificial light could extend their photosynthesis duration. Though a tree with pristine leaves may be more enjoyable for some people to look at, it could be a bad sign for the ecosystem. “Leaves that are free of insect damage may bring comfort to people, but not insects,” said Zhang. “Herbivory is a natural ecological process that maintains the biodiversity of insects.” Zhang added: “Decreased herbivory can lead to trophic cascading effects in ecology. Lower levels of herbivory imply lower abundances of herbivorous insects, which could in turn result in lower abundances of predatory insects, insect-eating birds, and so on. The decline of insects is a global pattern observed over recent decades. We should pay more attention to this trend.” — Helena Horton , The Guardian ALSO ON YALE E360 To Foil a Deadly Pest, Scientists Aim for a Beetle-Resistant Ash Tree","Streetlights left on all night cause leaves to become so tough that insects cannot eat them, a study has found.

Joshua Brown Scientists have recovered an intact poppy seed and other plant remnants buried under two miles of ice in the heart of Greenland. The finding indicates that during a prior warm era, Greenland was almost entirely ice-free — an ominous precedent on a rapidly heating planet. The poppy seed, as well as the compound eye of an insect, broken willow twigs, and spikemoss spores were found in sediment recovered from the tip of an ice core that had been held in storage since 1993. “We now have direct evidence that not only was the ice gone, but that plants and insects were living there,” said lead author Paul Bierman, of the University of Vermont. “And that’s unassailable. You don’t have to rely on calculations or models.” The discovery , published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , suggests that the Greenland ice sheet had almost completely melted at some point in the last million years. Writing in The Conversation , authors warn that humans are “on pace to warm the Arctic and Greenland beyond temperatures they have experienced for millions of years.” If the Greenland ice sheet were to thaw today, they note, it would raise sea levels by more than 20 feet over the coming centuries. “Look at Boston, New York, Miami, Mumbai, or pick your coastal city around the world and add 20-plus feet of sea level,” Bierman said. “It goes underwater.

Rick Bowmer / AP Photo A new study has found that the Great Salt Lake, which has lost 73 percent of its water, is releasing climate-warming emissions. For years, scientists and environmental leaders have been raising alarm that the Great Salt Lake is headed toward a catastrophic decline. Now, new research points to the lake’s desiccating shores also becoming an increasingly significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists have calculated that dried out portions of the lakebed released about 4.1 million tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in 2020, based on samples collected over seven months that year. Their study , published last month in the journal One Earth, suggests that the Great Salt Lake — which is the largest saltwater lake in the Western Hemisphere — and other shrinking saline lakes across the world could become major contributors of climate-warming emissions. The research also adds to a dire list of environmental consequences brought on by the lake’s precipitous decline. Last year, environmental and community groups sued Utah officials over failures to save the famous lake from irreversible collapse. In recent decades, as more and more water has been diverted away from the lake to irrigate farmland, feed industry and water lawns, a report last year estimated that the lake had lost 73 percent of its water and 60 percent of its surface area. Its decline was accelerated by global heating and a megadrought in the U.S. Southwest. The declining lake has exposed a dusty lakebed laced with arsenic, mercury, lead, and other toxic substances that threaten to increase rates of respiratory conditions, heart and lung disease, and cancers. As its volume shrinks, the lake is also becoming saltier and uninhabitable to native flies and brine shrimp. Eventually, scientists have warned that it may be unable to support the 10 million migratory birds and wildlife that frequent it. “I think the impacts on air quality, the impacts on migratory birds and other wildlife are maybe more pressing, locally,” said Soren Brothers, a climate change curator at Canada’s Royal Ontario Museum, who led the study. “But especially at a time when we are all trying to find ways to reduce our carbon footprint, as Salt Lake City is working to reduce emissions, this desiccating lake is adding some of that back.” Other research has documented emissions from other saline lakes, including the Aral Sea in central Asia, though more research is needed to fully understand the extent. Both saline and freshwater lakes can act as carbon sinks, he noted — in some cases locking up huge amounts of carbon in their sediments. But as the climate crisis hastens the decline of these lakes, they could begin unleashing large amounts of carbon dioxide that in turn could exacerbate global heating, creating a vicious feedback loop. Brothers said they hope the study encourages researchers to take more measurements of emissions from across and around Great Salt Lake to better understand how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases it is absorbing and emitting. “I think this research adds just one more to a long list of reasons we should be working to preserve the lake,” said John C. Lin, an atmospheric scientist and associate director at the University of Utah’s Wilkes Center for Climate Science and Policy. In a study published in June, Lin and his colleagues also found that exposure to particulate pollution from the lakebed was highest for Pacific Islanders and Hispanic residents, and lowest among white residents — probably because minority and low-income communities are more likely to lie in the path of wind-blown dust from the lake. Preserving the lake’s levels would decrease dust pollution and reduce stark racial disparities in exposure to air pollution, the researchers found. “There’s now a lot of attention on the lake and that gives me hope,” he said. “Because the crisis has galvanized the community to try to do something.” He’s part of a team of researchers helping to turn the lake’s fate around by 2034, when Utah is set to host the Winter Olympics. “There are a lot of eyes on Utah and Salt Lake City right now.

The finding strengthens the legal case for regulating heat-trapping gases. Under former president Barack Obama, the Environmental Protection Agency put forward a regulation on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. But in 2022 the Supreme Court scrapped the standards, asserting that Congress had not empowered the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases. A new review of historical records challenges the conclusion of the Supreme Court. Undertaken by researchers at Harvard and Duke, the research finds that the authors of the 1970 Clean Air Act understood that burning fossil fuels would warm the planet, and they considered carbon dioxide to be a pollutant. While lawmakers did not view carbon dioxide as an imminent threat, they did believe the greenhouse gas would eventually need to be regulated. At the time the law was crafted, there was already a growing awareness of climate change. Reports for presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon warned of planetary warming, and such information began to penetrate the public consciousness as Americans learned about the greenhouse effect by reading popular magazines , watching television , or in school .

Muskie, a Democrat from Maine, warned at the time that unchecked pollution would “threaten irreversible atmospheric and climatic changes.” The study, soon to be published in Ecology Law Quarterly , concludes that Congress “understood far more about the potential threat of anthropogenic climate change than either the [Supreme] Court or most commentators have recognized.” ALSO ON YALE E360 How an Early Oil Industry Study Became Key in Climate Lawsuits","A new study finds evidence that Congress intended for the 1970 Clean Air Act to cover carbon dioxide emissions.

12232,2024-08-01 09:49:00,Yale Environment 360,https://e360.yale.edu/features/kristie-ebi-interview,"In Warming World, Global Heat Deaths Are Grossly Undercounted",Climate Change,Public Health & Environment,"The global average temperature continues to rise, with the two hottest days ever recorded occurring last week, and the human toll of extreme heat is growing larger every year. In the United States, heat waves are now considered the deadliest weather-related natural disaster. But because heat deaths may present as heart attacks, kidney failure, or other diseases, experts agree that heat-related deaths are grossly undercounted. Earlier this year, the Federation of American Scientists called on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to upgrade and expand its health-tracking systems to more accurately reflect the true toll of heat waves on human health, to develop guidelines for states reporting on heat-related deaths, and to integrate environmental conditions with electronic health records. Knowing how many people a year die due to heat would not only raise public awareness of the issue and help save lives, says Kristie Ebi, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington who has been studying the impact of climate change on human health for more than 30 years, it will also ensure that investments in heat resilience reflect the magnitude of the problem. “I think it’s important to step back and recognize that those deaths are preventable,” Ebi noted in an interview with Yale Environment 360 . “People don’t need to die in the heat.” Kristie Ebi University of Washington Yale Environment 360: This summer is shaping up to be one of the hottest on record in the U.S. You have studied the question of excess deaths during heat waves. Do we know how many people are dying? Kristie Ebi: The number of excess deaths is much higher than what is reported because those numbers come from death certificates, and those typically are people who die from heat stroke. But that’s just a tiny fraction of the total number of people who die during and immediately after a heat wave. Excess death analyses after a heat wave indicate about 50 percent of all deaths are from cardiovascular causes. The CDC’s estimate of heat deaths, about 1,200 Americans a year, is probably at least a tenfold undercount. An estimate from several years ago was that, in the U.S., there are actually in the range of 10,000 to 12,000 heat-related deaths, and that is likely higher today. e360: Why is there such a gap between the actual number of excess deaths and the numbers that are attributed to heat? Ebi: Think of two people going into an emergency department with a heart attack. One was pushed over the edge into the heart attack because of the heat. The other was not. There’s not a way to tell at the individual level, in the middle of a crisis, which heart attack could have been exacerbated by the heat and which was not. In both cases, the cause of death will be recorded as a heart attack. But we can tell at the population level. As with COVID, you look at the number of deaths during a particular time period, compare it with earlier time periods when there wasn’t an epidemic, when there wasn’t a heat wave, and that gives you a relatively accurate count of excess deaths. But again, at the individual level, making that attribution is pretty challenging. “Heat is a silent killer… Often the first sign people are in trouble is they get confused and can’t always judge what is happening.” e360: So it’s more accurate to look at the excess deaths for a period than to look at, say, what a doctor writes on the death certificate? Ebi: That’s correct. Because the focus of the emergency department has to be on trying to save that life, and you don’t really want to change that dynamic. But there’s also people who die from kidney causes, from respiratory causes, from a range of other issues, and parsing out how heat contributed to those illnesses is challenging at the individual level. But at the population level it’s relatively straightforward. e360: Over the past several months the Federation of American Scientists, which works to minimize the risks of significant global threats, including climate change, has made several statements calling for the adoption of a standard methodology to measure heat deaths. Would that help? Ebi: The CDC is actively considering doing this because they are acutely aware that current estimates of heat-related mortality significantly underestimate the burden. The goals of understanding the numbers of deaths from heat include raising awareness and ensuring that the level of investment reflects the magnitude of the problem. While it would be desirable to have precision, there are tradeoffs in achieving it. Investigating all deaths during a heat wave to determine which were associated with heat requires resources and time, which would take away from other priority health issues. First responders treat Deb Billet, 66, for heat-related symptoms, Henderson, Nevada, July 10, 2024. John Locher / AP Photo e360: Do we have any idea how sharply the excess deaths are increasing due to heat waves in the past, say, decade or two? Ebi: We do have studies looking at the numbers of excess deaths, and they are increasing with climate change in some places but not in others because people are adapting to those changes. And of course, communities are adapting to those changes by implementing early warning systems, putting in cooling shelters, and by making other changes to try and protect the population. e360: Do we know what percentage of heat deaths is actually due to climate change? Ebi: There is abundant evidence that heat waves are increasing in frequency, intensity, and duration. There was a big modeling study that came out a couple of years ago, it looked at 43 countries, and the answer was, on average, 37 percent of heat-related summer mortality over the last several decades was due to climate change across those countries. e360: You’ve said elsewhere that people don’t think of heat as something that they should be worried about. But what you just said suggests this may be changing, that people are becoming more aware of the dangers of heat than they were a few years ago. Ebi: And thank you to the media for covering this story and helping people to understand that indeed they are at risk. Heat is a silent killer. Some early warning signs of heat stress are nausea, fatigue, and dizziness. But it can be challenging, because often the first sign that people are in trouble is they get confused and can’t always judge for themselves what is happening. It means that all of us need to pay attention to family, friends, and colleagues to make sure that they’re doing okay when the temperatures are high. “This emphasis on whether the future will be livable doesn’t take into account the creativity of human beings.” e360: People don’t typically start dying or having really severe reactions on the first day of a heat wave. Why is that? Ebi: It goes back to your core body temperature and how that temperature affects your cells and your organs. It’s not instantaneous. It does take a while for the cells and the organs to start reacting to the high temperature. And that’s why it’s 24 hours after the start of a heat wave when you start seeing the impacts. e360: We’ve been talking mostly about the U.S., but in large parts of the world, heat is getting to levels that are threatening to any human life outside. Are there whole countries that are going to be entering the unlivable zone pretty soon? Ebi: I think it’s important to step back and recognize that those deaths are preventable, that people don’t need to die in the heat. This emphasis on whether it’s going to be livable doesn’t take into account the creativity of human beings. We live in all kinds of environments that are not livable. People live in Antarctica for several months a year. Humans have found ways to modify infrastructure, to modify clothing, behavioral patterns, to be able to survive in very extreme conditions. Our emissions of greenhouse gases are making it more complicated, of course. And so putting the emphasis on how we can prevent those deaths is, from my perspective, a priority. Rooftop gardens on a school in Nanning, China. Costfoto / NurPhoto via Getty Images e360: What are some of the things that we should be doing now to design the world to better withstand these heat events? Ebi: We need to develop heat action plans with two major components. One is heat-wave early warning and response systems, with the emphasis on the response. It’s not just telling people it’s hot. It’s telling them what they can do about it and ensuring they have access to services, making sure that there are cooling shelters, making sure that there’s outreach to the unhoused, making sure that your outdoor workers are protected, that people living in elderly care institutions have access to cooling. The other part of a heat action plan is the long-term planning. What are our cities going to look like in 30 to 50 years? Will everybody be required to have a white roof? Will buildings over a certain size be required to have a green roof? Are we planting the trees that will cool our neighborhoods and that are going to survive in a hotter future? e360: So you’re hopeful? Ebi: I’m basically a worried optimist. e360: The worry I can understand. Where does the optimism come from? Ebi: The optimism comes from the fact that our society is always changing and that there are constant advances. And it also comes from my students. They really care about climate change issues, and they’re committed to helping us find even more solutions in the future.

Because heat deaths may present as heart attacks, kidney failure, or other diseases, experts agree that heat-related deaths are grossly undercounted.

Copernicus Climate Change Service New analyses find that warming is fueling severe hot spells on both sides of the Atlantic this summer, spurring warnings about the need to guard against increasingly dangerous heat. On Friday, close to half of Americans will endure heat made three times more likely by warming, according to a report from Climate Central . Heading into the weekend, extreme heat will bear down on the Rocky Mountains, the Great Plains, and much of the Southeast, with high humidity sending the heat index , an indicator of how hot it feels, above 110 degrees F (43 degrees C) in some parts. The U.S. hot spell follows a heat wave that settled over southern Europe in July, when temperatures topped 104 degrees F (40 degrees C) in parts of Spain and the Balkans. A new analysis from World Weather Attribution finds the heat would have been “virtually impossible if humans had not warmed the planet by burning fossil fuels.” Heat has proved especially dangerous in Europe, though estimates of heat deaths vary significantly. Official records tend to undercount such deaths — a heart attack prompted by a hot spell will be recorded as a heart attack, not a heat death. Scientists can infer how many people are actually killed by heat by tallying the number of excess deaths during hot periods, though methods differ. According to one study , which gauged the effect of even modest warmth, heat has killed more than 175,000 people in Europe each year, on average, since 2000. The World Health Organization warned this week that heat deaths are set to rise in Europe as the planet warms. “Extreme heat is a problem particularly for elderly people, especially those living alone,” said Hans Kluge, European regional director for the WHO. “It can also place an additional burden on pregnant women.” He stressed the need to care for vulnerable people, protect outdoor workers, and stem warming. The period from July of 2023 through June of 2024 measured 1.5 degrees C warmer than the preindustrial era, meaning the world has at least temporarily surpassed the temperature target set forth in the Paris Agreement.

12616,2024-07-30 10:26:00,Yale Environment 360,https://e360.yale.edu/features/internet-of-animals-icarus,The ‘Internet of Animals’ Could Transform What We Know About Wildlife,Wildlife & Conservation,Public Health & Environment,"Field biologists tend to be a patient lot, often resigned to long days and weeks in the field and committed to experiments that take years to yield results. But even among that dogged crowd, Martin Wikelski stands out. Back in 2001, sitting on a porch one evening in Panama, the German ornithologist had the germ of an idea for an “internet of animals,” a global system of sensor-wearing wildlife that would reveal the planet’s elusive, nonhuman worlds. He figured he could get it up and running by 2005. Nearly 20 years later, Wikelski may have finally succeeded — after surmounting roadblocks that range from bureaucratic mishaps to technical glitches to a geopolitical crisis. His space-based system, known as ICARUS (International Cooperation for Animal Research Using Space), is now scheduled to launch, in its latest, satellite-based incarnation, on a private rocket sometime in 2025. The underlying idea of the internet of animals is to tune into the planet’s hidden phenomena — the flight paths followed by sharp-shinned hawks, the precise fates befalling Arctic terns that die young, the exact landscape requirements of critically endangered saiga antelope — by attaching tiny, solar-powered tracking devices, some weighing less than a paperclip, to all kinds of organisms and even some inanimate objects (glaciers, ocean plastic debris). The inexpensive, globe-spanning system of animal tagging is meant to help scientists understand the precise drivers of global change, and much more, by tracking thousands of tagged animals from space and tying their experiences to the broader impacts facing whole populations or even species. Beginning sometime next year, the ICARUS project plans to launch receivers on five low-cost miniature satellites. Wikelski, the director of the Department of Migration at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, in Germany, said the prospect of having that data, and of “making people aware of the incredible beauty and richness of what’s happening out there,” has made the effort worthwhile, even urgent. It’s also true, as he wrote in his recent book The Internet of Animals: Discovering the Collective Intelligence of Life on Earth , that he “had no clue how many pitfalls there would be… how many times when we desperately wanted to give up, because the whole process had become so exquisitely frustrating that we just couldn’t stand it anymore.” In 2018, after years of working with designers, engineers, and government officials from multiple countries and continents, Wikelski’s team saw its ICARUS receiver launch aboard a Soyuz rocket from Kazakhstan to the International Space Station, where Russian cosmonauts attached it to their side of the orbiting lab. “We danced, cried, and hugged one another,” Wikelski wrote of the launch. “All the stress of nearly 20 years fell away.” The internet of animals went live in March 2020, but before the year was out, mechanical issues on the Russian ISS module took the system down. Nearly a year passed before it was up and running again. By the spring of 2021, the system was finally humming along, receiving data from roughly 3,500 tagged animals around the world. But then, in the winter of 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, and the West cut ties with Russia. ICARUS’s transmission of data abruptly halted. Russian cosmonauts install the ICARUS receiver on the outside of the International Space Station, August 2018. Alexander Gerst / ESA After the ISS failure, Wikelski’s team set out to redesign the system to use satellite-based receivers, which had always been its long-term aim. In 2022, plans seemed almost set for an ICARUS receiver to orbit on the next GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite, a joint venture between NASA and the German space agency, scheduled to launch in 2028. But last-minute political haggling siphoned more than a third of the project’s German funding, leaving no money to include ICARUS. “We were totally devastated,” Wikelski recalled. He gave his project three months to find a solution or finally give up. “That’s when we scaled down and said, we need a CubeSat.” And so beginning sometime next year, the project plans to launch ICARUS receivers on five relatively low-cost CubeSats — miniature satellites roughly the size of a Rubik’s cube and weighing only a couple of pounds — using private launch companies. Funded by the Max Planck Society, the system will cost roughly $1.57 million to launch and have annual operating expenses of around $160,000. “The geopolitical aspect of this is pretty huge,” said Michael Wunder, a quantitative ecologist at the University of Colorado Denver who used the ISS tags to study the migration patterns of mountain plovers before the war in Ukraine cut off the research. Instead of involving government space agencies, the project’s new iteration keeps the scientists in control. Tiny tags record animals’ movements and body temperature, as well as air temperature, air pressure, and wind speed. The new system allows for greater global coverage — the ISS receiver couldn’t communicate with tags at the planet’s highest latitudes — and Wikelski’s team has used the intervening years to shrink the tags by several grams and design new ways for animals to “wear” them, vastly expanding the number of species scientists can study. The team is currently upgrading 4,000 older tags to work with the new system. The tags provide hourly accounts of the animal’s energy expenditure; measure environmental factors like air pressure, altitude, temperature, and humidity; and even use AI to help interpret the animal’s behavior. The trove of data “will open a lot of doors for researchers,” said Ashley Lohr, who coordinates North American projects for ICARUS through the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. “How stressed was the animal? What were the environmental conditions when the animal was at this place at this time?” Wunder’s lab group tagged 17 mountain plovers in Colorado in 2021. Native to the plains of the north-central United Staes, the species has declined by 80 percent in the past six decades. But the birds are hard to study because of their habitat and behavior. “They’re singing and vociferous but not in your face,” Wunder said, and in breeding season they like their space, living in densities of only about three birds per square kilometer. The plovers often occupy private ranchlands, which makes them hard to find without trespassing. And they breed in late March and April, while bird surveys, timed to count migratory songbirds, happen in May. Biologist Martin Wikelski tags a scarlet macaw with an ICARUS transmitter. Courtesy of Martin Wikelski Wunder has long sought to understand whether mountain plovers follow distinct, structured migration patterns or whether birds from different areas mix together in winter flocks. He also wants to learn what drives the birds to migrate. “Are they moving away from something or toward something else?” he asks. He also hopes to determine exactly where the birds are running into trouble. Before the ISS receiver went dark in 2022, the ICARUS tags revealed that the plovers didn’t follow fixed migration routes and that birds from around the country were mingling in the winter. When several transmitting birds died, Wunder was able to dispatch researchers to their locations and discover the cause of death — predation. The birds started returning to Colorado in February, and Wunder was eager to see which ones would come back — but then the war in Ukraine began. “We were cut off, there was no more information,” he said. Ellen Aikens, a biologist at the University of Wyoming who did her postdoctoral research on animal migration at the Max Planck Institute, believes that ICARUS could serve as a “democratizing force” in ecology and biology. It’s a way to level the playing field, she says, so that “folks that have a smaller budget or are working on species that are a bit more obscure and there’s not as much funding behind can start to get the same kind of information, baseline info, about where those [animals] are going.” As animals travel, says one expert, they can collect environmental information that can better inform climate models. In her lab, Aikens is studying golden eagles using a tag made by the German company e-obs . “It’s the gold standard of biologging in bird research, if you can afford it and your bird is big enough to carry the transformer” — like geese, storks, and eagles. A single e-obs tag costs more than $1,500 and works over a cellular network, meaning researchers must also pay the cost of data transmission for as long as the animal lives. “If you want to get a good sample size that will allow you to publish your research, that adds up really quickly,” Aikens said. “ICARUS tags are cheaper by an order of magnitude.” Aikens believes that ICARUS will help transform the way scientists study animals. Our nonhuman neighbors “can take a pulse of the planet and be detectors of change and help us understand the health of the environment,” she said. “As [animals] move these vast distances, they can collect detailed environmental information that can better inform climate models and collect information in places that are difficult to monitor,” whether high in the sky, deep in the ocean, or under a thick layer of ice. ICARUS tags are solar-powered, whereas some existing tagging systems run on batteries, which can die — ending the research on that individual or requiring recapture to change them out. Other tagging systems rely on animals passing by a signal tower. It works for certain animals, like birds and bats, but not for others. “Because ICARUS is satellite-powered, you don’t have to wait for your animal to go back on the grid and pass by a tower,” said Lohr. Instead, each time a satellite passes over an area, data from nearby tagged animals will be uploaded to Movebank, an open-access database. A year of animal movements as tracked by ICARUS and other research groups around the world. Data compiled by Movebank.  Ultimately, researchers hope that ICARUS data can “help us pinpoint effective conservation strategies,” Aikens said. “It can help us identify pinch points on the landscape.” While this is already happening for some species, including North American ungulates like elk and pronghorn antelope, whose migrations researchers have tracked for years, for most of the planet’s species “we lack this data and this wide coverage of information, which makes these fine-scale interventions a lot harder to achieve. That’s a place that ICARUS can help fill in a lot of gaps.” And if the internet of animals can zero in on specific issues — for instance, a bird species dying out because a particular insect it eats is being killed by a particular chemical being sprayed in an area — Wikelski believes such information could drive people to act. “People are willing to do something about it if they know that what they do is really helpful,” he said. For now, Wikelski continues to practice patience. When I spoke to him in early July, he was dealing with the latest hurdle: satellite launch delays, including one caused by a payload issue and another caused by an ill-timed summer holiday that delayed authorization of the $30,000 payment needed to secure a launch reservation. “Our project is now too small to really be on everybody’s horizon,” he said. “Before, it was too large.” Nevertheless, Wikelski was hopeful. His team was studying and perfecting the lowest-stress methods of tagging animals and even testing automatic tagging systems, like one for deer involving a salt lick and a tiny elastic band. He remained confident of ICARUS’s potential. “One really important aspect we think is transformative in biology is the scaling up of tagging,” he said. “So you don’t have one animal but 50 or 100, or you do it across a continent.” Over the next two years he plans to tag 9,000 animals in Europe, including blackbirds, storm thrushes, swifts, and sparrows in a study already underway. Roughly 7,000 of those 9,000 would die in the first year, he said, based on general patterns. “That means we are finally understanding where they disappear. Where are the death traps? These tags are so smart, they can tell us if a female is nesting and if the clutch disappears. So we can not only get information on where the adults are living and dying, but have the adults been successful in hatching or clutching? Is there a massive problem in a certain area? Then we can link individuals to populations and understand the drivers of change.”","Martin Wikelski has been working on an ""internet of animals"" since 2001.

The society said Comet A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) has been called the ""comet of the century"" because of how bright and visible it can be. On Saturday the comet is expected to come within about 70 million km (44 million miles) of Earth, according to the Nasa Earth Observatory. The RAS's Dr Robert Massey told BBC News that Saturday night was the ""opening of the window to try"" and see the comet in the UK. He said people should go out ""immediately after sunset"" with a pair of binoculars, head for higher ground and look west towards the horizon. Try to stand where hills, buildings and trees are not blocking your view, he said. Skies will be clearing overnight on Saturday as strong winds push the cloud and showers away into the North Sea. Dr Massey advised people to ""wrap up"" and bring a hot drink with them. ""Just go out, enjoy it, don't sweat it,"" he said. The RAS said the comet was first visible in the southern hemisphere between 27 September and 2 October and would be visible from Saturday night to 30 October. The comet likely travelled from the outer reaches of our solar system and made its closest transit past the sun on 27 September, the Nasa Earth Observatory said. Dr Massey said the nucleus of the comet - its solid core - has been estimated to be 2km (1.24 miles) long, or ""mountain-size"". He said he tried to spot it on Friday night and will ""certainly try again"". ""Sometimes comets disappoint... but this one appears to be acting in line with predictions,"" he said. ""We want people to try and go out and have a look."" Comet A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) was photographed in Spain, Italy, Uruguay, and Indonesia between 29 September and 1 October. Dr Massey advised using a DSLR camera to capture the comet, but said holding a mobile phone camera up against the eyepiece of a small telescope could snap the space event too. On the RAS's website, he said: ""And if it’s genuinely easy to spot, you might, might be able to pick up your mobile phone, rest on something, and just point and shoot."" The comet follows the UK's skies being splashed with colour from the Northern Lights overnight on Thursday. The lights, also known as aurora borealis, were expected to be seen only as far south as the Midlands, but the spectacle was visible from the top of the UK in the Shetland Islands down to London. Is there a link between the comet and the Northern Lights? ""It's a nice coincidence,"" Dr Massey said. Have you seen the Comet A3?

Jason Pettigrew / ODF Scientists have discovered that ponderosa pines effectively stop breathing when beset by wildfire smoke. The finding helps clarify the impact of wildfire smoke, which has been difficult to study, as scientists cannot predict when fires will break out and must take caution when working near blazes. In the fall of 2020, scientists from Colorado State University got lucky. They were studying how trees in the Rocky Mountains emit the compounds that lend forests their piny aroma when heavy smoke from a nearby fire settled over the research site. With equipment ready, they were able to measure the smoke’s impact. Scientists found that, amid the haze, ponderosa pines closed the tiny pores on the surface of their leaves, which allow them to take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen. When pores closed, photosynthesis came to a halt. The findings were published in Geophysical Research Letters . Writing in The Conversation , study authors concluded that “some plants respond to heavy bouts of wildfire smoke by shutting down their exchange with outside air. They are effectively holding their breath, but not before they have been exposed to the smoke.” Authors speculated that smoke may be clogging pores or preventing them from opening. It may also be that leaves are closing their pores at the first sign of smoke in an act of self-preservation. ALSO ON YALE E360 The Beleaguered Whitebark Pine Is in Trouble.

The survey, undertaken by the Marine Conservation Society, found just one plastic bag, on average, for every 100 meters of coastline, down from five plastic bags in 2014. It was roughly a decade ago that governments began requiring retailers to charge consumers for single-use plastic bags. Charges were introduced in Wales in 2011, followed by Northern Ireland in 2023, Scotland in 2014, and England in 2015. The price per bag currently stands at 25 pence in Northern Ireland, 10 pence in England and Scotland, and 5 pence in Wales, which plans to end the sale of plastic bags entirely in 2026. “It is brilliant to see policies on single-use plastics such as carrier bags working,” said Lizzie Price, of the Marine Conservation Society . “But we cannot afford to rest on our laurels.” Overall, the survey recorded 167 bits of plastic litter for every 100 meters of coastline, with bottles, lids, strings, and wrappers among the most commonly found items.

13128,2024-07-23 12:34:00,Yale Environment 360,https://e360.yale.edu/features/barred-owls-spotted-owls-hunting,Grim Dilemma: Should We Kill One Owl Species to Save Another?,Wildlife & Conservation,Public Health & Environment,"On July 3, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service released a plan to start killing 15,000 barred owls a year in the Pacific Northwest, starting as soon as this fall. This extraordinary initiative — more than a dozen years in the making — is intended to save the imperiled northern spotted owl from extinction. Barred owls have been moving west into spotted owl territory for decades, aggressively outcompeting them for prey and nesting sites. If its plan is adopted, the federal agency will soon launch what’s expected to be a three-decade campaign in which certified hunters will eventually shoot nearly half a million barred owls. “We’re wildlife conservation professionals, and we don’t take this lightly,” said Bridget Moran, a field supervisor for the Fish and Wildlife Service in Bend, Oregon, who has been working on the strategy. “The spotted owl is at a crossroads. We have the science to indicate what we can do to conserve spotted owls, and [it’s] telling us that we must manage barred owls in addition to habitat to save them.” The plan, as presented in a final environmental impact statement, has garnered opposition, largely from animal welfare and anti-hunting groups, but also support from mainstream environmental groups. The Fish and Wildlife Service adopted its plan based largely on a study of “invader removal,” published in 2021, in which researchers set up five pairs of test plots. On one plot, they left barred owls and spotted owls to their own devices. On the other plot, they shot any barred owls that entered. A long-term field experiment showed that where barred owls were killed, the population of spotted owls stabilized. The researchers eliminated 2,485 barred owls over several years in the managed plots. Where barred owls and spotted owls were left alone, the population of the threatened species declined around 12 percent each year. Where barred owls were killed, the population of spotted owls stabilized. “The use of long-term field experiments to test the effectiveness of removals in benefitting impacted native species is rare,” said David Wiens, a U.S. Geological Survey biologist and the lead author of the paper. “This study is the largest field experiment ever conducted on the demographic consequences of invasive competition between predatory birds.” Steep population declines of northern spotted owls, which live only in old-growth and mature second-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest, raised alarms more than 35 years ago. Continued logging of those forests, experts said at the time, would drive the bird to extinction. In June 1990, the bird was listed as a threatened species in the Pacific Northwest and logging in its habitat was restricted. The federal action created a storm of controversy, but it prevented the extinction of the spotted owl. Efforts to prevent the disappearance of the owl, then and now, are not just about protecting a charismatic predator. Spotted owls are an indicator species for the health of the old-growth ecosystem: If a forest has adequate populations of flying squirrels, mice, and salamanders to sustain spotted owls, the forest is likely to be diverse and healthy. Spotted owls only live in mature forests, while barred owls can thrive in both young and old forests and eat a far wider range of prey. Left: a barred owl. Right: a spotted owl. Ray Bosch / U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; David Roelofs / Bureau of Land Management Logging of old growth forest on public lands has, for the most part, halted, and some logged areas are now being restored. But while the logging battles have died down, the new controversy over the proper response to what has been called an invasion of barred owls has heated up as the Fish and Wildlife Service’s final decision nears. Biologists believe that the barred owl began moving out of eastern North America and across Canada with the westward movement of European settlers. In a two-part paper , the former FWS biologist Kent Livezey concluded that the lack of trees on the Great Plains created a barrier to owl movement until settlers appeared. They excluded fire from ecosystems, which eventually allowed forests to spread, and they planted trees on farms and in towns, all of which provided an expansion of roosting habitat. Wheat and other grain farms may have increased the numbers of mice and other prey. Barred owls were first observed in Washington, Oregon, and California in the 1970s, and today there are more than 100,000 of them living in the northern spotted owl’s territory in those states, according to federal biologists. When barred owls move into spotted owl habitat, the impact is rapid and thorough. The interlopers are larger and more aggressively territorial. They drive spotted owls away from their nests and outcompete the smaller birds for food. At least half the spotted owls in the forests of the West have been lost to barred owls, says the Fish and Wildlife Service, and some places have lost three-quarters of their historic population. When barred owls colonized Redwoods State and National Parks in Northern California, starting in 1987, the spotted owls all but disappeared. Biologists considered capturing and sterilizing barred owls, but they would still return to their territory and displace spotted owls. The plan to shoot barred owls will protect the northern spotted owl, a subspecies that occurs in Northern California, Oregon, Washington, and southern British Columbia, which now has fewer than five northern spotted owls, including a lone female. The number of northern spotted owls in the United States isn’t precisely known: Estimates put the population at just a few thousand. Its continuing decline, however, is steep. In areas where roughly 200 spotted owls lived in the early 2000s, only two or three birds remain, said Robin Bown, a FWS biologist in Oregon. The bird is currently listed as threatened. FWS scientists say it is warranted for listing as endangered, but the agency says such action is precluded because it must focus on higher priority species. The California spotted owl, another subspecies, was last year proposed for listing as endangered in the southern part of its range and threatened in the Sierra Nevada. Barred owls are just beginning their invasion of that bird’s habitat, and the FWS strategy is to dispatch them as soon as they are detected. The Mexican spotted owl is listed as threatened in both the U.S. and Mexico but is not currently threatened by the barred owl. Though the plan to kill hundreds of thousands of owls is extreme, federal wildlife officials say other options simply aren’t available. Capturing the birds and moving them elsewhere was contemplated. “We contacted the eastern states where barred owls are native, to see if they wanted barred owls back,” said Bown. “They said ‘no.’ Their existing habitat is already full.” Moving them could also spread disease and parasites. They also considered capturing and caging barred owls, but maintaining so many birds would be prohibitively expensive, never mind the fact that there aren’t enough qualified facilities to house barred owls for the rest of their lives. The ranges of barred owls, northern spotted owls, and California spotted owls. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Biologists also considered “reproductive interference” — capturing barred owls and sterilizing them. But released owls would simply return to their territory, displacing spotted owls, and stay there until they died, Bown said. The federal government has long experience with eliminating wild animals to preserve endangered species. To protect endangered warblers and other songbirds, hundreds of thousands of cowbirds, a nest parasite, have been killed annually. Wildlife managers in Washington and Oregon lethally inject sea lions to protect salmon runs. Feral hogs are routinely slaughtered to protect threatened and endangered species. The Fish and Wildlife Service plans to work with individual landowners and representatives from tribes and federal and state agencies, training and certifying volunteers to remove the invasive species as humanely as possible. The service emphasizes that there is no public hunting of barred owls permitted. “Before anyone can do this, they have to meet our qualifications [for permitting],” said Bown. “They have to have training, knowledge, and experience.” Shooters will need to know their owls. Barred owls have a distinctive call that sounds like “Who cooks for you?” Though spotted and barred owls are similarly colored, barred owls are a bit larger and have vertical and horizontal striping, while spotted owl markings are horizontal. Animal rights groups call the movement of invasive owls ‘adaptive range expansion’ and an instinctive response to climate change. “We have removed 4,500 barred owls with the same protocol in experimental removals in the last 12 or 15 years without a single non-target injury or death,” said Bown. Shooters will head into the woods at night, with flashlights and megaphones. “We will project territorial barred-owl sounds,” said Bown, explaining what’s known as a callback survey. “If barred owls are there, they will respond and usually approach us.” Shooters must be within a hundred feet of their target, she said, and “have a good clean shot.” Carcasses will quickly be buried in the forest. Around 15,000 barred owls will be killed each year for 30 years — totaling some 450,000 birds. Biologists estimate the maximum number of owls removed annually will be less than the estimated annual growth of the entire barred owl population. The barred owl removal plan has drawn criticism as well as reluctant support. Hilary Franz, the Commissioner of Public Lands for Washington State, has concerns about the culling. She posted comments , which she sent to Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, about the planned culling on YouTube. “It raises enormous amounts of questions,” she said. “How can the Fish and Wildlife Service guarantee that only barred owls will be targeted? How can we prevent the surviving barred owls from simply recolonizing and repopulating the very areas we are trying to preserve? And with so many species now facing extinction, how can we justify spending nearly a billion dollars on one species when our funding and resources are limited?” The Fish and Wildlife Service has said the cost of the project has not yet been tabulated. Wildlife technician Jordan Hazan records data from a barred owl killed as part of an experiment aimed at preserving spotted owls, Corvallis, Oregon, October 2018. Ted S. Warren / AP Photo The primary opposition has come from animal rights and welfare organizations. In March, 75 organizations led by Animal Wellness Action president Wayne Pacelle sent a letter to Haaland opposing the shooting of the birds, calling the movement of invasive owls “adaptive range expansion” and an instinctive response to climate change. “We cannot victimize animals for adapting to human perturbations of the environment, perhaps especially the all-encompassing effects of climate change,” they wrote. The Center for Biological Diversity, meanwhile, is supportive of the cull. “I hate to see any animal killed, but the spotted owl will certainly go extinct without an effort to reduce invasive barred owl populations,” said Noah Greenwald, the conservation group’s endangered species director. “I’m hopeful that in combination with protections for old-growth forests on federal lands, barred owl control will give the spotted owl a real chance at survival.” The American Bird Conservancy also supports the plan, as do some, but not all, Audubon chapters. Denver Holt, a leading owl researcher who is president of the Owl Research Institute, in Charlo, Montana, questions whether the birds are truly invasive and believes their range expansion across the boreal forest in Canada may be natural. “I’m concerned,” he said. “They are using the invasive category to kill so many owls. I’d like to see an independent review.” But the Fish and Wildlife Service says action must be taken now. “If we don’t do this, the spotted owl will go extinct,” said Bown. “That’s not a hard prediction to make.” Correction, July 23, 2024 : An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that wildlife managers in Washington and Oregon lethally inject sea otters to protect salmon runs. They inject sea lions, not sea otters.","The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service released a plan to start killing 15,000 barred owls a year in the Pacific Northwest. Barred owls have been moving west into spotted owl territory for decades. If its plan is adopted, the federal agency will soon launch what’s expected to be a three-decade campaign in which certified hunters will eventually shoot nearly half a million barred Owls. The plan, as presented in a final environmental impact statement, has garnered opposition, largely from animal welfare and anti-hunting groups.",http://res.cloudinary.com/drwsupfyj/image/upload/v1728767177/state-of-the-earth/news_photographs/grimdilemmashouldwekilloneowlspeciestosaveanother.jpg

As mercury settles in water and soil, it is taken up by wildlife. Mercury becomes more concentrated as it moves up the food chain, as larger creatures, such as tuna, accumulate the toxin by consuming smaller creatures, such as sardines, en masse. Past studies have focused on the higher end of the food chain, measuring mercury in fish and birds, but the new research looks toward the bottom. Though nearer the source of mercury, dragonflies have the advantage of being found almost everywhere — in lakes, rivers, forests, wetlands, and deserts. For the new study, scientists enlisted the help of the public in gathering samples of dragonfly larvae from 150 national parks. The mercury found in larvae bears a chemical signature indicating its origin, the study notes. An analysis of the dragonfly larvae revealed that in arid regions, mercury comes from snow and rain, while in wetter, more forested areas, airborne mercury clings to leaves, which then fall to the ground, where the toxin spreads. The findings were published in Environmental Science & Technology. By one estimate , the amount of mercury in the atmosphere has grown sevenfold over the last 500 years, primarily from burning coal. Mercury has been linked to brain damage in children and heart disease in adults. By turning to dragonflies to track pollution, said lead author Sarah Janssen, scientists were “able to uncover surprising results that have the potential to change how mercury is monitored and managed at a global scale.” ALSO ON YALE E360 To Foil a Deadly Pest, Scientists Aim for a Beetle-Resistant Ash Tree","As mercury settles in water and soil, it is taken up by wildlife.

NOAA A new study suggests that metals scattered about the deep ocean may be producing oxygen, a finding that could strengthen the case against controversial deep-sea mining. Scientists have long assumed that plants and other photosynthetic life were the only source of oxygen on Earth. The new study , published in Nature Geoscience , challenges that view, showing that polymetallic nodules, potato-size lumps of minerals found on the seafloor, may be another source. Scientists made the discovery while sampling the seabed in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a ridge extending 4,500 miles across the eastern Pacific. When they discovered oxygen 13,000 feet underwater, in areas so dark that photosynthesis would be impossible, they initially thought their equipment had malfunctioned. Eventually, they came to suspect the polymetallic nodules were a source of this “dark” oxygen. When combined with saltwater, rust can generate electricity, enough to liberate the oxygen atom from a molecule of water. Researchers thought nodules may serve the same function, and so they tested them in a lab. One nodule, they found, could produce close to 1 volt of electricity. When clustered together, nodules could generate enough electricity to split seawater. Researchers say that the finding adds another wrinkle to plans to mine polymetallic nodules, which contain many of the metals used for EV batteries. Sixteen firms currently have mining claims in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, which boasts enough nodules to meet the global demand for EV metals for decades, experts say. “The polymetallic nodules that produce this oxygen contain metals such as cobalt, nickel, copper, lithium, and manganese — which are all critical elements used in batteries,” said study coauthor Franz Geiger, a professor of chemistry at Northwestern University. “We need to rethink how to mine these materials so that we do not deplete the oxygen source for deep-sea life.” ALSO ON YALE E360 Can We Mine the World’s Deep Ocean Without Destroying It?","Polymetallic nodules, potato-size lumps of minerals found on the seafloor, may be another source of oxygen.

The region has five LNG export facilities in operation, and at least 16 new export facilities have been approved or are under construction or regulatory review. Roishetta Ozane, a Lake Charles, Louisiana-based activist who cofounded the organization Vessel Project in the wake of back-to-back Gulf Coast hurricanes in 2020 that left her homeless, is currently rallying communities in Cameron Parish to block construction of an export terminal called Calcasieu Pass 2, or CP2. If built, it will be one of the largest LNG export terminals in the country and, according to a Sierra Club estimate , annually produce greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to those of more than 42 million cars. In January, the Biden administration paused approvals of all new LNG exports while the Department of Energy evaluates whether the projects are in the public interest. Despite the pause, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved CP2 in late June. In an interview with Yale Environment 360 , Ozane explains why she is currently traveling the nation to educate voters about links between fossil fuel infrastructure, climate change, and racism. “We need to start talking about how these issues are connected,” she says, “how the people in these communities all look alike, and why they’ve been sacrificed for so long.” The Calcasieu Pass gas export plant under construction Cameron Parish, Louisiana. A second export plant, Calcasieu Pass 2, is planned. Venture Global Yale Environment 360: How did you come to found the Vessel Project? Roishetta Ozane: In 2020, I’d ended up homeless with my six children after losing everything in Hurricanes Laura and Delta. I realized that I lived in a community that was surrounded by billion-dollar industries that had very little resources for people who looked like me. I got on Facebook and asked, “Who needs help?” So many people needed food. They needed water. People were newly homeless. I was looking at the connections between industrial pollution, the storms that were happening across Louisiana and Texas, and the proposed industry coming along the Gulf Coast. I was beginning to recognize how all of this was connected when I heard about these 20 proposed LNG terminals. My first question was, “Where are they going to go?” I had this overwhelming feeling that they were going to push out more Black communities. I didn’t want that to happen, so I wanted to educate people. e360: What does it mean to say the Vessel Project is a “mutual-aid” organization? Ozane: I don’t have any federal funding. I get a few small grants from organizations, but a lot of the funding comes from crowdsourcing from across the U.S. I assist people with food, shelter, water, clothing, paying their utility bills, paying their rent. But then they come to our community outreach meetings, they protest. [In late June] I was able to organize over 200 people from Texas and Louisiana to march with over 1,000 people down Wall Street to tell banks to stop funding environmental racism in our communities. I can’t talk to a person in my community about CP2 coming when they can’t feed their families, when they can’t pay their rent. We’re building community from the ground up, making sure that our community is strong enough to withstand whatever comes at it. “I immediately knew that those industries were bad… The air smelled like rotten eggs one day and like Clorox the next.” e360: Were you already noticing the impacts of the petrochemical industry in the air, in the water? Ozane: I’m originally from Mississippi. When we first came to Louisiana in 2003, I immediately knew that those industries were bad because we could see the fires and the smoke. The air smelled like rotten eggs one day and like Clorox the next. It made me sick. One of my sisters who worked at a petrochemical plant ended up being diagnosed with cancer at age 30. Her job was to watch the flare to see how big or small it would be, but she didn’t know what was coming out of that thing. Three of my children have eczema, and two have asthma. My son was recently diagnosed with epilepsy. He started having seizures last year, at the age of 17. He had his first seizure while driving between two facilities that had flares going. Those flares are loud, they are bright, and those are seizure-triggering things. It was also a couple days after the explosion at [a local refinery]. I tried to get answers, but everybody I talked to said that the chemicals released from these facilities disappear out of your blood quickly. e360: Is anybody tracking the incidences of cancer, asthma, epilepsy in the region? Ozane: There have been studies done by Tulane and LSU, but the studies I’ve seen have been paid for by industry and are biased. The state of Louisiana has said that even though cancer rates are going up, there is no way to say that they’re going up because industry has grown. Louisiana is third in the nation for cancer rates. People hear about Cancer Alley, not understanding that the entire state of Louisiana is a cancer state. I live about three and a half hours from Cancer Alley, and my community is surrounded by more than a dozen petrochemical and gas facilities and three LNG facilities. Roishetta Ozane driving through Lake Charles, Louisiana. Martha Irvine / AP Photo e360: How does liquid natural gas harm the environment even before it’s burned? Ozane: LNG is produced by super cooling the gas into a liquid. The process of liquefying releases methane into the atmosphere. And shipping it across the ocean means more tanker traffic and dredging, more pollution, more pollution of our seafood. It’s all for export, while driving up our energy costs here. Natural gas prices in southwest Louisiana are some of the highest in the state. e360: But it’s bringing jobs and infrastructure? Ozane: They don’t provide the number of jobs they promise, and the folks who are working at those facilities are retiring with cancer. If they’re bringing so many well-paying jobs, why are these communities still in the shape they’re in? Why are people still reaching out to my organization for assistance paying their rent and their light bills? e360: How much does racism play into all this? Ozane: Racism plays a big role, because when white and wealthier people were saying, “We don’t want these facilities in our neighborhoods,” they were built in low-income and people-of-color communities. The Vessel Project fought coal in Westlake, Louisiana, and right behind coal came LNG. And right behind LNG, now, you have [new] petrochemical plants. And right behind that is coming CCS [carbon capture and sequestration]. It’s coming to the same communities over and over and over. “Cancer Alley in Louisiana is not the only Cancer Alley. Other communities that look like mine are overrun with polluted air.” e360: How much do you make climate change an explicit part of the conversation at Vessel Project? Ozane: I’ve learned through doing this work that if you want to bring people to the table, you have to be gentle when you’re talking about issues that have been politicized. So we might not necessarily say the words “climate change,” but people understand that something is wrong when two historical hurricanes come to one area back-to-back. And that’s followed by a flood, and that’s followed by a freeze, and they’re pushed out. You’re talking about a red state in the South, so we try to keep those types of words out of the conversation and instead teach people that your environment starts with your body. If you’re not breathing clean air and clean water, you’re not healthy. You’re not going to feel well, which contributes to you not wanting to go to work, not being able to be your best self. We talk about industrial pollution, methane emissions. We can have a crawfish boil and we talk about the fact that we had less crawfish this year than last year. And somebody in the audience is going to say, “That’s because of climate change.” We don’t have to put it on the flyer that we’re talking about climate change, but because we’re connecting the dots, people get it. Damage from Hurricane Delta in Cameron Parish, Louisiana in October 2020. STRINGER / AFP via Getty Images e360: It appears that the Department of Energy is set to decide on the license for CP2 in January 2025. Ozane: We’re pushing them to speed things up. Because we don’t know how this election is going to go. We’re hoping people will vote on the issues that are going to save their communities. We need the Biden administration to be in office again to make sure that the policies he’s enacting are turned into bedrock legislation. The state of Louisiana just had a judge try to overturn the LNG pause. The FERC approved this permit for CP2, fully knowing it can’t go anywhere without its DOE permit. [With the Sierra Club and the NRDC] we’re taking all the necessary steps to bring this to court and get this permit thrown out. e360: To what extent are your activities now focused on the national level? Ozane: In the short term, I’m focused on elections at home, in Louisiana. I am trying to make sure that people in communities that look like mine are registered to vote, are educated on the issues. On the national level, I’m trying to go to states that have communities that look like mine to connect these issues so that people know these are not one-offs. Cancer Alley in Louisiana is not the only Cancer Alley in the United States. Other communities that look like mine are overrun with polluted air, polluted water. Flint, Michigan’s water crisis is also happening in Sulphur, Louisiana. There’s a water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi. We need to start talking about how these issues are connected, how the people in these communities all look alike, and why they’ve been sacrificed for so long. e360: Given the latest developments on CP2, how do you maintain your optimism? Ozane: Every morning when I wake up, I see my children, and they have this happiness, these smiles. And let me tell you, my children are not hidden from this. If you look back at our Climate Week post, you’ll see my children on the frontlines holding banners. But the fact that they still get up every day smiling, laughing, knowing the fight ahead, it gives me hope. Because I know that if I don’t live to see any of what I’m fighting for come to fruition, I am raising the next generation of environmental activists, of climate activists, and the fight will continue until we win.
